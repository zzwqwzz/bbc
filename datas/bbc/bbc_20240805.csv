,"An agricultural show which was first held in Lancashire more 200 years ago will launch again later.
The Garstang Show aims to bring the local community together to celebrate the role of farming, food and the countryside.
Events in the main ring will include horse and cattle shows, and a history of agriculture through the decades will show off a display of tractors and vintage farm machinery.
Exhibitor Emma Benson said: ""It's a very important event. We love supporting our local shows, getting out and meeting all the local people.""
The first Garstang Show was held in 1813 and featured sweepstakes and prizes or “premiums” - dished out for the most impressive crops and stock.
Rivalry from other local shows in Goosnargh, Lytham and Gt Eccleston caused entries and attendances to decline and shows lapsed around 1840, before re-starting about 1855.
Secretary Gill Billington said one highlights of this year's one-day spectacular is ""a performance where you can see tractors through the ages"".
She said: ""We start with the vintage from the 1950s showing how tractors, farming and agriculture has changed, and showing the different machines and how things have progressed. 
""And we will end showing the next generation of farmers and how they are going to take on the mantle and move food production forward.""
Organiser Helen Smith said there will be about 1,000 entries in the horticulture marquee ""ranging from floral art to people growing fruit and vegetables"".
""There's a lot of work goes in to putting it all together"", she added. ""But it's an absolute spectacle.""

,"In the family tree of British apples, there have long been some prominent holes. It's the equivalent of a great-grandfather whose name has been forgotten. He's there in all the old photographs, staring out at you. But who is he?
The DNA of some apple varieties, for instance, shows that they are descended from a lost tree, one that must have existed, but whose identity is unknown. Scientists called this ""ghost apple"", a parent of varieties like 
 and 
, Unknown Founder 8.
DNA is no longer the 
, however. Apple fanatics across the UK are now taking samples from very old apple trees in hopes of learning more about antique varieties, and perhaps making some surprising discoveries.
Most apples are grafts, or clones, of trees that grew long ago, so these old trees may be varieties you can't buy anymore, as traditional favourites have lost out to modern industrial crops. For anyone interested, in the spring, you can pick a few bright green new leaves from an ancient tree in your back garden, and send them off to a laboratory. If someone's sent in a sample before that's been confidently identified as a particular variety, you'll get a match.
When John Teiser, a Hereford-based apple maven, lays this all out for me, leaning on a paddock gate in an orchard, I can tell he's tickled to bits. Just last week, Teiser got an email from his friend Ainsleigh Rice, part of the 
 in the Welsh Marches. He had some big news: Unknown Founder 8 is unknown no more. They got a match for its DNA from a tree in Gloucestershire.
The identification of Unknown Founder 8 is just one of the discoveries people are making as they bring British apples into the DNA age, making it easier to identify and preserve what's left. It's a heady time for apple enthusiasts like Teiser. I can hear the excitement in his voice.
Right in front of us, in fact, is a potential source for more surprises. In this paddock and the next one, surrounded by busily munching sheep, there are more than 150 different types of cider apple tree. They were all made by taking grafts from a now-decrepit orchard planted nearly a century ago by Bulmer's, the cider maker. Teiser manages this collection under an agreement with the charitable trust that runs the 
, a short drive away through tiny country lanes on the outskirts of Hereford, close to the border between England and Wales.
Though these trees have had a basic genetic identification, Teiser hopes to have a more in-depth sequence run at some point, one that could give more details about how these trees fit into the family tree.
Teiser is also waiting to hear back about the DNA results from another old collection nearby. He is very curious about what that might show.
That's because there are apples, documented in 19th-Century books like 
, that have slipped through people's fingers. There's the 
, a cider apple that was once incredibly common, 400 years ago, in the Forest of Dean: the last known confirmed example was destroyed in the mid 20th Century. There's the 
, a cider variety Teiser encountered once as a young man. Although there are other apples with that name out there, none of them match the one he knew, which was lost when the tree that produced the fruit was uprooted for a driveway. 
It's his pomological White Whale, the apple that haunts his thoughts.
With more detailed information from DNA analysis, Teiser and others on the hunt for lost varieties can rule candidate apples out. There was one apple in another Bulmer's orchard, for instance, that had been labeled ""Upright Medaille d'Or"" in an old plan. The fruit seemed a close match for Hogg's descriptions of the Forest Styre. Teiser was intrigued. ""I thought well, could this be the lost Forest Styre?"" he said. Genetic testing revealed, however, that the apple was in fact a close match for a French variety. The case of the missing Forest Styre remains open.
Undaunted, Teiser is always on the lookout for apples that may be an ancient variety in disguise. In fact, he and Rice think they have uncovered just such an apple, documented by Robert Hogg in 1884. It's been going by the name Freetown Yellow, but Teiser and Rice have put together a detailed argument that is actually the 
, a greenish-yellow cider apple.
Putting the right names to old things matters: British apples are part of a heritage that goes back centuries, and though apple orchards have dwindled in the country, there are people willing to put in the time and effort to keep alive these varieties, which are often adapted to the particular conditions here. Charles Martell, a Gloucester cheese maker and apple expert, for instance, has made a career of finding and 
. It was an apple he found in 1993 that turned out to match Unknown Founder 8.    
Unknown Founder 8 was revealed to be a tree called the 
. It has lime green fruit, with a pale pink flush, Martell wrote in a description in his book Native Apples of Gloucestershire. It's a cooking apple, best stewed or in a tart. And some time, way back when, it was a parent to many far better-known varieties.
Back in the Museum of Cider in Hereford, Teiser examines apple portraits made by a watercolorist long ago to accompany Robert Hogg's descriptions of fruit. The Golden Winter Permain, the Kentish Pippin, the Golden Spire – they seem to leap off the paper, round and ready to be picked.
For now, Teiser eagerly awaits his next batch of DNA results. There's one particular orchard, with a few very old trees, for which he is greatly looking forward to getting back the results. ""It was in a similar orchard that we discovered the lost Kempley Red (aka Carrion Apple!) last year,"" he writes to me in an email. I looked up the Kempley Red in Hogg's book: the watercolour shows it red with striations of crimson and yellow. It's a winsome thing and worth looking for.

The show, which has been running since 1834, is at its traditional venue of the Stithians Showground. 
Show chairman Nigel Vague said he was expecting about 15,000 to 18,000 visitors. 
For those attending, he said there was an ""excellent traffic management team"" so there ""won't be any problems with transport"". 
Discussing what visitors could expect, Mr Vague said: ""We cover everything from cattle, horses, sheep and we got pigs this year, which is a big new section for us.""
However, one absentee at this year's show is poultry

There will be more than 120 trade stands, hundreds of exhibitors and a large variety of displays and activities for people to enjoy.
The show’s chairman David Kempster told BBC Radio Shropshire he was looking forward to welcoming visitors and hoping for good weather after downpours last year.
“There is lots for everybody to see, agricultural and non-agricultural,” he said.
Mr Kempster said he was a third generation chairman of the show, following in the footsteps of his father and grandfather.
The event was first held in 1862.
He said there was a sense of pride in being the third member of his family to take the reins.
He added: “But also, there is a great sense of pride in what the show provides for the local community and how it promotes agriculture in the area.”

The four-day event, held at Llanelwedd, near Builth Wells in Powys, usually attracts about 250,000 people from 40 different countries.
It is an agricultural festival that takes place every summer and aims to showcase the best of Welsh livestock.
This year's event begins on 22 July and ends on 25 July.
There are various events which take place each year, including the judging of sheep, cattle, pigs and horses, sheepdog trials and carriage driving displays.
There are also stalls and exhibitions, displays of country sports and traditional Welsh crafts.
It is not unusual for the show to welcome a royal visitor.
King Charles III was recently made patron of the Royal Welsh Agricultural Society and has visited the festival a number of times - including in 2013, the day after his first grandson, Prince George, was born.
A member of the crowd greeted him with a cry of 
There are a variety of competitions that take place throughout the four days.
Many of these involve livestock, such as horses, cattle, sheep, pigs and goats, with almost 7,000 animals being exhibited.
There is also a variety of non-livestock competitions - ranging from floral displays to stick making, wood chopping and a tug-of-war.
This year there will also be a horticultural village, featuring a variety of gardens with different themes.
The show's director, Richard Price, said the new village would be ""a celebration of community and commercial growing"".
It is due to be officially opened by BBC Gardeners' World presenter Sue Kent.
What many visitors regard as the highlight of the week is cob day, which is traditionally held on Wednesday afternoon.
More than 50 Welsh cobs - horses - are paraded in front of a packed crowd before being judged in the main ring.
They compete for the ultimate prize, the George Prince of Wales Cup.
The show takes place in the village of Llanelwedd at the permanent Royal Welsh Showground, a 150-acre site built in 1963.
Before the showground was built, the annual agricultural show was held at no fewer than 37 different locations, alternating between north and south of Wales.
The showground is located where the A470 and A483 cross and free parking is available at the bottom end of the showground.
There are free park and ride car parks on all the main routes to the showground, with buses running between 07:30 BST and 21:30 each day.
For visitors coming by train, the nearest station is at Builth Road, just over one mile (1.6km) away from the showground.

,"Farmers have fought back against a proposal to switch a council in Devon to plant-based catering and encourage a shift to plant-based farming.
The plan was condemned as ""idiotic"" and ""a slap in the face for farmers"" at a North Devon Council meeting on Wednesday.
Ricky Knight, a Green Party councillor who put forward the motion, said he wanted ""to address the problems of climate change"".
The proposal was heavily defeated with all members voting against except for Mr Knight and his Green Party colleague who seconded the motion.
The motion asked the council to serve fully plant-based food and drink at internal meetings and events and for plant-based options to be prioritised and promoted throughout the district. 
It also called for the council to work with local farmers to support a move towards production of plant-based produce.
Mark Weekes, a Devon sheep farmer, said the proposal was ""ridiculous"".
He said: ""Here in north Devon it's absolutely idiotic to think we could have a completely plant-based council.
""Our great farmers work incredibly hard to produce sustainable and well-priced healthy food. Meat, above all else, is one of the highest, densest sources of protein that you can eat.""
David Chugg, a north Devon farmer and Devon NFU deputy chairman, said: ""I think it's very disappointing it's got to this stage. 
""Everyone should make their own decision on what they want to eat or not eat.""
Robin Milton is the Independent councillor for Bishops Nympton ward but was not allowed to vote on the proposal due to his position as a livestock farmer.
He said: ""North Devon is a very rural area that is based around livestock farming predominantly and the potential to go for entirely plant-based production is virtually impossible here.
""The environmental impacts would be huge, the jobs impacts would be huge and the impacts on the landscape, our tourism, everything that's great about north Devon would be challenged.""
During the meeting, David Worden, Liberal Democrat member for South Molton, said the proposal was ""a slap in the face for farmers"".
Liz Bulled, Conservative member for North Molton, said livestock farming was ""the bedrock of north Devon"" and said people needed ""freedom of choice to eat what we want to eat"".
Local authorities like Exeter 
 at meetings and events.
Michaela Andrews from the Plant-Based Councils campaign group is trying to get more councils to switch to vegan catering.
She wanted councils to ""lead by example"" and ""show this is a clear solution to the climate crisis"".
Ms Andrews said eight councils in England had switched to plant-based catering and said this had sent ""a powerful message to the world that this is the way we need to be heading as a  society"".
Mr Knight said he hoped the proposal would help North Devon Council ""to continue its conversation"" with farmers in the area.

,"Farm incomes in Northern Ireland almost halved in 2023, new figures from the Department of Agriculture, Environment and Rural Affairs (Daera) show.
The 
 that total income from farming (TIFF) fell from £609m in 2022 to £341m in 2023 - a reduction of 44%.
TIFF is the return on own labour, management input and own capital invested.
Farmers bought less fertiliser and lime in 2023, but spent more on feedstuffs, which accounted for more than half the total value of gross snputs.
Across all farm types, 
 by 46% a farm from an average £51,043 in 2022-23 to £27,345 in 2023-24.
The reductions are expected mainly in cereal (-80%) and dairy farming (-70%).
But increased pig prices mean incomes from pig farms are expected to rise by 84% in 2023-24.
Higher beef prices also mean incomes from cattle and sheep in less favoured areas - a classification of land that is not as productive - and cattle and sheep in lowland farms are expected to increase by 8% and 3% respectively.
The agriculture and environment minister said fluctuating market conditions were not a new problem, but remained a ""very difficult"" issue for farmers.
Andrew Muir added that fluctuations were mainly due to price influences in world markets which are outside Daera's control. 
""Consequently, my department focuses effort on helping farmers mitigate cost and price pressures by improving their productivity and resilience, while also addressing their environmental sustainability levels,"" he said.
""These are the goals of our new farm support and development programme.""
Mr Muir also said the College of Agriculture, Food and Rural Enterprise in Antrim continued to offer ""relevant training and support to farmers"".
Total gross output for agriculture fell to £2.87bn in 2023, almost a third of which was comprised of dairying (£892m).
The amount of milk produced and the price per litre it attracted also fell.
Intensive sectors - poultry, eggs and pig production - all saw increases in the value of their output, although production fell in the pig and egg sectors.

,"A young farmer from County Londonderry who lost his sight in one eye in a farm accident has told BBC News NI that it will not stop him doing what he loves.
Ryan Taggart, 21, was working for an agricultural contractor in Shropshire when he suffered the life-changing injury.
He was 19 when he was hit in the eye with a small piece of metal while working on machinery.
New figures from the 
 show that eight people were killed on Northern Ireland's farms between April 2023 and March 2024. 
In GB, 27 people were killed in agricultural-related activities, according to the HSE. 
“I was changing the shoe of a sub-soiler and I took the roll pin out and the shoe wouldn't come off, so I hit it with a hammer,” Mr Taggart told BBC News NI.
""A bit of metal fragmented off the shoe and went into my eye.”
The shrapnel cut through Mr Taggart's eye, scarring the retina.
He says he is only able to make out shapes and light in his right eye, but is “very lucky” not to have lost his eye. 
""You think it could never happen to you, but at the end of the day things like this do happen to people,"" he said.
This week marks the 12th year of Farm Safety Week, an annual campaign organised by the 
 (Yellow Wellies) across the UK and Ireland.
HSE NI said almost 50% of the reported work place deaths in 2023/2024 were farm related. 
Robert Kidd, chief executive of HSENI says that while every death is an ""absolute tragedy"", over the last 12 years ""the figures are much improved"".
""We have seen years where there were more young people died as a result of accidents,"" he added.
""Thankfully, in the last couple of years that has been greatly improved, but we are still aware that there's a lot to be done and certainly eight fatalities last year is hugely disappointing. 
""The contribution farming makes both to the economy and to a rural community is is very important and we don't want to see any loss or any families grieving."" 
After several surgeries, Mr Taggart has continued to work full-time in farming, and returned home last year to work on his uncle’s dairy farm outside Kilrea.
While the accident means he “looks at life in a different way”, a career change was never really an option.
“It took me a while to get over it, but you don't want to stop doing something you love,"" he said.
“You just have to deal with it. 
""I don't think anyone could have stopped me from doing it.
“Why should it stop me doing what I love?” he said.
“It happened me when I was 19 years old; if I get another 60 years I’ll be doing well. 
""There’s no point looking back when you’ve your whole life to look forward to.”
Mr Taggart says he made “a lot of adjustments” after his accident and is now risk aware.
The 21-year-old believes farmers can learn from people working in other sectors, such as construction.
“Farming is normally seen as a family business and it’s not looked at as a proper business which creates added risk,” he said.
HSENI said ""farming is a unique situation"" compared to other industries with young people often living in the workplace and people working beyond retirement age. 
Mr Kidd said they were particularly concerned about the amount of older people being killed on farms with the youngest fatality last year in their 60s and some in their 70s and over 80.
""It suggests there might be a complacency or perhaps that farmers are thinking they're still as able as they were 30-40 years ago and they're just not as quick and agile.
""We're now putting a big focus on those older farmers.""
Ryan’s story shows how a split-second decision can have long-lasting consequences.  
Despite his sight loss, he is lucky.  
Eight deaths in a year are still eight too many, and life-changing injuries can affect more than the person who suffers them.  
Farms are not like other businesses – almost 80% of the 26,131 in Northern Ireland are classed as very small, run by families.  
And that often means one farmer working alone with no staff and certainly no health and safety officer or risk assessor.  
Sometimes there isn’t anyone to help with tasks on the farm which can heighten the risk when working with animals, equipment, slurry or at a height.  
The ageing profile of farmers – now on average in their late 50s – also brings its own challenges.  
So campaigns like Farm Safety Week still play a part in saving lives.

Four officers from the team have been switched to helping support victims of domestic abuse. 
It leaves the rural crime team down to two staff members - an Inspector and a Police Community Support Officer (PCSO).
 The force says an increased demand for police services this time of year is behind the decision.
Jeremy Padfield, 56, farms in Stratton-on-the-Fosse. He is also the chairman of the Froome, Bath and North East Somerset branch of the National Farmers Union (NFU). 
He says: ""It's frustrating because we have worked very hard as the NFU and as a group of farmers with the rural crime team in Somerset. We've formed some good relationships, there's a lot of intel we feed into them.
""If it's (redeployment of officers) till the end of August then we can live with that. 
""Where it might just lag over in the next four or five weeks is around the follow-up procedures after crimes have taken place.""
Ch  Supt Elizabeth Hughes, Head of Neighbourhood and Partnerships, said: ""We’re wholeheartedly committed to keeping our rural communities safe and responding to rural crime in all its forms, especially incidents which are in progress.
""Demand during the summer increases by around 20 per cent and last year, we saw incidents graded as requiring an immediate or priority response rise by around 30 per cent.
""We’ve learned from experience and will be adopting an approach which better spreads the workload across directorates to ease the pressure on any one team.
""This was not a decision I’ve taken lightly, but we must deploy our resources to meet demand and where the threat, harm and risk is highest.""
The force emphasised that responses to 999 calls will not be impacted, and that officers from their Neighbourhood Policing teams will assist the Rural Crime Team with ongoing enquiries during this period.
Given the redeployment, Mr Padfield told his fellow farmers to ""always be vigilant"".
""It probably takes me 15-20 minutes every day to go around and check all gates are locked and padlocked and all machinery is locked away in the barn safely,"" he said.

Trevor Edgley, who runs the Nightlayer Leek Company in Chatteris, Cambridgeshire,  found himself unable to drill wheat due to persistently wet fields during the spring.
He said he planted a special seed mix on land off the A142 between Chatteris and Mepal - called NUM3 - which encourages insects and wildlife.
 ""I think you'll start to see a lot of it about, ours has come out early because we drilled it in April, whilst we still had some moisture in the soil,"" he said. 
Planting NUM3 is a government ""sustainable farming incentive"" (SFI), which improves soil health and mitigates the impacts of extreme weather through rotation.
""The government [sustainable farming incentive] pays farmers £593 per hectare per year to grow the crop,"" Mr Edgley said.
""We have to pay for seed, labour and establishment costs out of that money. 
""Spring wheat and barley are not always that profitable, so for me, it is a safe bet to sow NUM3, and it is better for the environment too.""
Commentators on social media believed the crop was linseed, borage or lavender.
""I was planning to sow wheat, but the rain has been so bad, the fields were under water till mid-March,"" Mr Edgey added.
""The wheat seeds have been kept in storage, we will do a germination test on them later this year, and fingers crossed, they'll make it for next year.
""I have about 100 acres growing this fairly new crop, NUM3, a mixture of seven seeds that is designed to encourage insects, bee's, pollinators and farmland birds it is also a way to manage nutrient efficiency and improve soil health.""
NUM3 seed mix is made up of 50% vetch, 15% linseed, 15% buckwheat, 7.5% crimson clover, 7.5% berseem clover and 5% phacelia - which provides the vivid purple flower.

""Through SFI, our aim is to support farming and farmers,"" a spokesperson said.
""We want to protect and improve the environment, food production and food security. We obviously don’t want SFI to be used in a way that comes at a cost to any of them.

However, Clare Barber MHK said the risks to humans and other animals would have to be ""carefully considered"" before any changes could be made.
It follows a call for permission to bury carcases on private land by the Manx National Farmers' Union after recent price increases for lost stock disposal which it said were

Ms Barber told the House of Keys any changes posed ""a significant risk"" by potentially compromising the island's ""ability to trade animals products"".
The Department of Infrastructure's animal waste section holds an exclusive contract to collect and dispose of dead animals from Manx farms.
Increases in the costs for the disposal of fallen stock were implemented at the start of July, with the price for the collection of a bull jumping by 185% to £152.70.
The government previously said processing plant price rises were ""considered an appropriate measure"" as it faced an ""average annual net loss of just under £500,000 over the past five years"".
Jason Moorhouse MHK asked Ms Barber if there was ""any possible solution"" to the issue as ""real frustration"" was being felt in the farming community, with some members continuing to withhold payments to the plant in protest.
Ms Barber said current legislation did not allow for stock that had died for reasons other than slaughter to be buried on farms ""except under exceptional circumstances"".
She told members the process posed risks to human and animal health from diseases such as foot and mouth disease and bovine tuberculosis.

But with demand increasing, more than 64,000 tonnes of blueberries are expected be imported in 2024.
Managing director Jim Floor said he wanted to encourage other farmers to grow British blueberries and stamp out mass importation.
“One of our main challenges is that the UK consumer hasn’t really worked out that you can get UK blueberries,” he said.
“It’s about making sure people realise that food miles and air miles are bad things, and that they should be supporting UK agriculture.”
The British blueberry growing season runs from June to September.
Last year, British blueberries were worth £607m to the UK economy. This year, that is expected to increase dramatically, Mr Floor said.
He said while the firm also grew strawberries, raspberries and blackberries, its biggest area of growth had been blueberries, adding that blueberries were “the perfect fruit”.
“I always say that if we could invent a pill that did all the things that blueberries do, then we would really have a winner on our hands,” he told BBC Radio Surrey.
“They are high in antioxidants, good at controlling cholesterol and blood pressure, helpful with mental health and cognitive controls and heart health.”

Mr Howells also voiced frustration with a ""lack of progress"" in negotiations with the Welsh government over issues like the new Sustainable Farming Scheme (SFS) and new rules to control agricultural pollution, due to be introduced in October.
The Welsh government recently announced it was delaying the introduction of its Sustainable Farming Scheme until 2026
The SFS is the Welsh government's big plan for funding the farming industry after Brexit, which puts more emphasis on the environment.
Under the proposals, farmers would be paid for actions resulting in environmental, animal welfare and social outcomes - over and above minimum legal requirements.
In order to gain access to the scheme, farmers would have to commit to having trees on 10% of their land, and earmark 10% as wildlife habitat. The scheme has been hugely controversial and has sparked protests.
In response a Welsh government spokesperson said: ""In May we introduced a new timeframe for the Sustainable Farming Scheme as part of a commitment to listening to farmers and rural communities. 
""The scheme will now begin in 2026, giving more time to engage with key partners. We will establish a SFS preparatory phase during 2025 to prepare farmers for entry into the new scheme.""
They added that the cabinet secretary for climate change and rural affairs had hosted two meetings of the SFS Roundtable which gives a wide range of stakeholders the opportunity to work together on the design of the scheme to resolve the remaining challenges.
Mr Howells said that farmers were still waiting for details on how to make their farms compliant with new rules to control agricultural pollution.
A Welsh government spokesperson said: ""We are beginning work to review agricultural pollution regulations, which is crucial to achieving our shared aims of an economically and environmentally sustainable farming sector. 
""The process of appointing an independent, external chair to oversee the review is underway and we look forward to sharing more information shortly.
""Since the introduction of the control of agricultural pollution regulations, we have offered over £31m of direct support towards on-farm infrastructure investments to help farmers meet the requirements.""

,"Ecologists have started work to turn a former livestock farm into a nature reserve.
Derbyshire Wildlife Trust hopes the land attached to Common Farm in Nether Heage will become a ""mosaic of habitats"" for insects, birds and mammals.
It said rewilding farmland could benefit food security locally by encouraging pollinators, improving soil health and soaking up flood water.
Supporters helped the trust to buy the farm through 
, which raised almost £300,000.
The new 83-acre reserve will help connect existing Derbyshire wildlife habitats at Crich Chase to the north and Wyver Lane to the south west.
Before it begins to manage the new site, the trust needs to know what is already there.
BBC News watched as ecologist Dr Jordan Holmes conducted baseline surveys of birds, soils and pollinators.
Her fieldwork involves binoculars, a spade and a large net. 
Sweeping her net through measured areas of the grassland, which used to be grazed by cattle, revealed disappointing results - a few leaf beetles, a micro-moth and a lot of flies.
""It's not particularly species-rich,"" Dr Holmes said.
""I'll count them and identify them to species-level and then we'll know how many species we've got on site and what sort of different groups they represent."" 
Dr Holmes said they should be able to tell whether their rewilding management made a difference when they conducted similar surveys in the future.
Experts working for the Derbyshire Wildlife Trust said they were well aware of the ongoing debate around rewilding farmland.
Their local landscape recovery manager Ellie Field said when the trust announced the purchase most people were supportive.
But a few did raise concerns that farmland should remain productive rather than being reserved for nature. 
""We are facing a food security crisis in the UK,"" she said.
""But nature restoration doesn't preclude food production. We want to address [food security] by using nature-based solutions.""

,"A new method of growing food could ""feed the world without trashing the planet at the same time"", according to an alternative farming entrepreneur.
Vertical farming is the practice of growing crops - such as rocket, watercress, basil and chives - in stacked layers, which are subject to artificial temperature, light, water and humidity control.
Fischer Farms said at capacity it can supply 1,000 tonnes of leafy greens, herbs and salads a day from its site in Norwich using the method.
Belinda Clarke, the director of Agri-TechE, said vertical farming could be ""a gamechanger for the industry"", but it had ""been really difficult to get the business model right"".
Tristan Fischer, the founder of Fischer Farms, said he believed the system could ""provide a significant amount of food stability around the world"".  
""They're emulating wind and sunshine, so we can have a night cycle for the plants, the wind makes the plants stronger and the sunshine helps them to grow,"" said grow assistant Samantha Wood.
Mr Fischer believed vertical farming could ""feed the world without trashing the planet at the same time"".
""The very sophisticated systems are expensive, there's a lot of up front capital costs and you need a high value crop,"" said Dr Clarke.
To ""justify the investment"", investors would need to grow crops for pharmaceuticals or ingredients for cosmetics or crops the UK currently imports out of season.
Dr Clarke suggested cereals, which ""we're quite good at growing to scale under free sunlight"", would be harder to justify. 
The company has trialled growing wheat and plans to move on to growing fruit followed by soy, wheat and peas. 
The crops are grown in a biosecure atmosphere, without pesticides, herbicides or insecticides.
Fischer Farms' four acre (1.61 hectare) Food Enterprise Park unit produces the same amount of food as a traditional 1,000 acre (404 hectare) farm, according to the company.
It also said the farm, which is funded by private equity firm Gresham House, is one of the biggest in the world, at 25,000 sq m (269,098 sq ft). 
The system does require a great deal of energy. 
Dr Clarke said this means vertical farming can only be commercially viable if it is built near a suitable energy source, such as a solar farm or an anaerobic digester.
Fischer Farms, which already uses existing solar panels on the farm's roof, plans to address its future power needs by using energy generated from a 130-acre (52-hectare) solar farm about to be built next door.

,"Welsh farmers are willing to work with “any politician” to reach a solution on the challenges facing the industry, a key union has said.
Gareth Parry, from Farmers’ Union of Wales, said there had been “a lot of political uncertainty” recently, but the “key asks” the sector had of both the Welsh and UK governments had not changed.
Recent months have seen large protests from farmers in Wales, who have expressed anger at planned Welsh government reforms to the sector.
The comments come days after 
 as Welsh first minister, after just four months in the job, and weeks after Labour won a landslide in the UK general election. 
A key issue has been the Sustainable Farming Scheme (SFS), the Welsh government’s flagship plan for funding the industry after Brexit, which places emphasis on the environment.
But following the protests, in May the Welsh government said the scheme would be delayed by another year until 2026, saying a new timeframe would give them the opportunity to “work through a number of important aspects”.
Speaking at the Royal Welsh Show in Llanelwedd, Powys - one of Europe's biggest annual agricultural events - Mr Parry said farmers in Wales wanted to ensure an agricultural system that guaranteed ""sustainable food production”, and served “all farmers, all farm types, all farm sizes in Wales"".
In order for that to happen, he said, policies must take into account their economic, social and environmental impact.
On the SFS, he said there was a concern it ""focused too much on the environmental proposals"".
""Farm businesses have to be economically sustainable for them to be able to invest in environmental measures and also to contribute to their local communities,"" he said.
Mr Parry also said there had been ""political uncertainty"" in both UK and Welsh politics recently, but the key demands of farmers remained unchanged.
Farming is a devolved issue in Wales, but decisions around funding are reached by the UK parliament in Westminster. 
""We are willing to work with any politician, any political parties for the best policy outcomes for the Welsh agricultural and rural communities,"" he said.
An ""open meeting"" held at the Royal Welsh Show attracted about 200 people on Monday evening.
Members of the farming community said they would keep pressure on the Welsh government not to implement the controversial plans that have, for now, been postponed.
NFU Cymru President Aled Jones said he thought the protests had made a difference.
""I think they have listened this time... there is a different feel and sense at the moment and the sense of urgency as well,"" he said.
""We must keep them to account, the commitments that we’ve had.""

Asked about the SFS on Monday, Mr Irranca-Davies said the programme was in the ""preparatory phase"" with a view to it being launched in 2026.
He said ""consultation"" with relevant stakeholders was key to getting the scheme finalised.
""We know the areas that are knotty issues, we’re working through them and we’re doing them at pace,"" 
.
""What [farmers] don’t want is people playing around saying, ‘Let’s tear things up, let’s have a look at alternative ways forward’,"" he said, adding there were many agreements on the ""headline issues"".
He added that, as well as addressing food sustainability, the Welsh government also wanted to ""fix critical issues with nature and climate resilience as well"".
Pembrokeshire dairy farmer Simon Davies described it as an ""up and down"" year for farmers, who had faced weather issues as well as political upheaval.
He said the original demand in the SFS of having tree-cover on 10% of a farm’s land and managing 10% as wildlife habitat ""doesn’t make our business viable"".
The government has said there is crossover with the 10% targets and farmers can still use land being managed for wildlife habitat - for instance a field with a variety of different species of grasses counts as habitat but can still be used to graze livestock.
Mr Davies hoped progress could be made on the issue with the new Welsh government.
""There’s got to be a compromise, surely,"" he said.
He added farmers were not against planting more trees ""in the right places"" but could not accept a ""blanket approach"".

,"A farm worker is warning people of the dangers of her profession after she was hurt in two quad bike crashes in her first year in the industry.
Erin Gailey, a herdsperson on a farm in Shropshire suffered multiple broken bones in the crashes in December 2019 and December 2020.
The 23-year-old spoke out after figures published by the Health and Safety Executive (HSE) claimed to show farming was the most dangerous job in Britain.
According to the research, 20% of workplace deaths happen on farms despite farmers making up just 1% of the working population.
Ms Gailey told BBC Radio Shropshire she moved away from her home in Evesham, Worcestershire, to work on a different farm in Shropshire when she was 18.
She was asked to go out on a quad bike on her fifth day and said she told her employer she had no experience with the vehicles.
“I was told ‘here’s the throttle of the bike, here are the brakes, the helmet is in the workshop somewhere’ and I got sent off. That was it,” she said.
As she was riding along a rain-soaked cow track, the bike slid off and she crashed into a fence post, breaking bones in both her hands.
She said she was off work for five weeks but when she came back, she was still using the quad bike every day.
On Christmas Day 2020, she crashed with a car as she pulled out of a junction, breaking her right leg which left her unable to work for five months.
Ms Gailey said she left the farm shortly after returning to work following a brake failure on one of the quad bikes.
She agreed farming was a dangerous industry and urged people to “know their limitations” before going into the sector.
“You could have the best employer in the world that has ticked every single box and done everything right but if you’re putting yourself in a stupid situation then things can still go wrong,” she said.
According to the HSE figures, 27 deaths were recorded on farms in Britain over the last year.
A charity, the Farm Safety Foundation, said it was a worldwide problem and there needed to be a ""significant change in culture"".
Spokeswoman Stephanie Berkeley said: ""We cannot continue to tolerate poor safety behaviours, we cannot assume that its somebody else’s job to drive this change in culture and we cannot rely on luck when going about our daily tasks.”

,"A company using drones in agriculture said it was not ""competing"" with traditional farming methods but ""complementing"" them. 
AutoSpray Systems started developing the use of drones in farming five years ago and managing director Rob Pearson said the technology is ""beginning to take off"". 
While their use can be beneficial to maintaining soil structure and reaching areas of farmland during wet weather, there are still restrictions on drones spraying pesticides. 
Mr Pearson said: ""Everything grows in the soil. It is the farmer's most valuable asset and the tractors compact it, they crush the ground, and this really damages the soil."" 
The company starts off by mapping out the field and the drone works out the most efficient way to apply seed or spray before it takes off. 
Mr Pearson said: ""This isn't here to compete with a tractor... when the fields are wet the tractors simply can't get into the field, but critically they cause compaction and they cause crop damage.""
He said use of the drone is a low carbon way of working and is a fraction of the cost of a tractor. 
""This really came into its own last year. It was a terribly wet harvest period, farmers had to keep their crops in the ground longer than they wanted until they were dry and ripened.
""We were able to put the next crop in three weeks before harvest effectively giving the farmer an extra month in its calendar year of growing."" 
Jeremy Buxton, who runs Eves Hill Farm in Booton, Norfolk, has started using drones after watching an episode of Countryfile featuring AutoSpray Systems on the BBC. 
He said benefits of using this technology on his regenerative farm was minimal soil disturbance and being able to get a ""living root"" into the soil before the crop has been harvested.
He said: ""We work so hard at improving soil structure and soil biology... with a drone flying above it there is no impact on the soil, be it from compaction or just moving the soil.
""I love regenerative farming... we are farming with nature rather than against it.""
While there are benefits, current restrictions mean drones cannot be used to spray pesticides that farmers would typically use, however, Mr Pearson hopes to see this change within the next 18 months.

,"More than 1,000 apple, cobnut and broadleaf trees have been planted on an RSPB farm to discover whether agroforestry could be a ""useful tool for farmers"".
The trees were planted on an 11 hectare (27 acre) site at the charity's arable farm, between Papworth Everard and Cambridge, in 2022.
The long-term project will be monitored for biodiversity, greenhouse gas fluxes and business viability, said assistant farm manager, Sophie Arnold. 
She said not enough was known about what an agroforest does or does not deliver in terms of ""trade-offs and benefits"" within the UK's farming system. 
An agroforest uses strips of crop-producing trees alongside arable crops.
""The long term hope would be that by putting agroforestry on the farm, we have diversified the farm business so that it could actually be a useful tool for farmers to be a little bit more resilient when farming's becoming increasingly more difficult,"" said Ms Arnold. 
""We've planted three different types of trees - 13 varieties of apples, all juicing varieties, three varieties of cobnuts, which is a commercial type of hazel which can hopefully be pressed for cobnut oil, and eight species of native broadleaves.""
The native trees will help protect the cropping species from ""the big rolling winds that come through our flatland Cambridgeshire landscape"", she added. 
They have been planted in eight six-metre (26ft) alleys, 24 metres (78ft) apart, on the RSPB's Hope Farm, which it bought in 2000.

In its latest report, NFU Mutual (NFUM) shows the cost of claims last year fell by 35%, from £3.6m in 2022 to £2.4m in 2023, in contrast to a 4.3% rise in England as a whole.
David Harrison, from NFUM, said the real concern was the impact on farmers, who lived on targeted farms with their families.
Thieves stole a £40,000 loader from Dave Eardley's farm near Market Drayton in March, and despite the new figures, he believes rural crime is ""out of control.""
""I don’t think that we should be victims in our own home, where we have to lock everything up,"" he told BBC Midlands Today.
""There may have been more people here that we’re not aware of in the night, or even in the day.""
Mr Eardley described rural crime as ""rife"".
""Different areas are targeted, it might've gone down in this region, and up in others,"" he said.
Rural crime includes theft of vehicles, livestock, fuel, dogs attacking farm animals, fly-tipping and illegal waste dumping.
NFUM believes the reduction in Shropshire is due to an ""increasingly co-ordinated response"" to crime, but said criminals were becoming more sophisticated.
Across the wider Midlands, there was also a reduction, but at 6.7% drop in the cost of claims.
Andrew Chalk, from NFU Mutual, said although the statistics were great news for Shropshire, it was important not to get complacent.
""£2.3m is still very high, that's still lots of farmers being preyed upon,"" he said.
He added that NFUM was seeing larger claims as a result of crime becoming more organised.
""There is an increasingly coordinated response to the threat of rural crime, we’re hoping that that is actually bearing dividends in helping to drive down the numbers,"" he said.
The report showed that nationally, the number of agricultural vehicle thefts had fallen, whereas thefts of GPS units rose by 137%.
Graham Donaldson, of West Mercia Police, believed a multi-agency approach was helping to reduce crime.
""We’ve had a long running operation with colleagues at Dyfed-Powys Police and North Wales Police, which we called Operation Gander, which was targeting known criminals who specialise in thieving rural equipment.""

,"On the car-free island of Sark, bicycles and tractors are the go-to mode of transport - except for Sundays when tractors are not allowed to be driven.
But now a group of politicians on the tiny Channel Island with a 
 are trying to change that, arguing Sunday is no longer considered a day of rest.
The move has sparked a row among residents - including one dubbed ""The King of Sark"" - who want to preserve the tradition.
Others argue times have changed and Sark needs to adapt.
The proposition to change the law has been submitted by members of the Douzaine, the body which looks after roads on the island, to be considered by the Chief Pleas in early July.
At the moment, tractors are the only motor vehicles which may be driven on the island - but their use is restricted to six days of the week.
Some people, however, have special permission to drive their tractor seven days a week.
Members of Sark's government have asked for the law to be changed so all tractors may be driven at any time.
In the proposition submitted by Conseiller Chris Bateson, chairman of the Douzaine, he wrote that ""there has been a gradual shift from the notion of 'keeping Sunday special' to it becoming 'just another working day'"".
His opinion was echoed by Bernadette Southern, chef at restaurant Fleur du Jardin, who said: ""It's totally different to what it was years ago, when Sunday was a relaxing day.""
She also said the summer season was now so short it was ""essential"" farmers and other people who needed tractors should be able to use them seven days a week.
She said: ""The boats change through the winter, so there aren't the same number of tourists. Everybody needs to make their money through the summertime. 
""Times really do need to change. I think everything else is changing so this needs to change too.""
However, Jason Salisbury, of Sark Dairy, said he believed the law should remain as it was, saying it was a selling point for tourists that the island was traffic-free, and that keeping one day a week with minimal tractor movement would ""keep Sark special"".
He said he did not want to work on Sundays despite working in agriculture.
He said: ""If you can't organise yourself not to try during a particular time, then you need to sort it out.""
As a compromise, Mr Salisbury suggested restricting tractors between 10:00 and 15:00, except for emergency services.
Peter Plummer, nicknamed the King of Sark, drives the tractor-towed bus service, known locally as the ""toast rack"" because of the shape of its passenger-carrying trailer, taking visitors up and down Harbour Hill on arrival and when leaving the island.
He holds special permission to drive his vehicle seven days a week and said he did not think the rule should be changed to allow everyone to do the same.
""If the rule is changed, I think people will take it for granted. 
""It's a slippery slope - at what point do you say no?""
He said that, despite dwindling summer seasons, allowing more tractor movement, and with it more dust and noise, would hurt the tourist economy rather than help it.
The proposition will be considered at the midsummer Chief Pleas on 3 July.
The report was originally on the agenda of the easter meeting of Chief Pleas but, owing to a vote of no confidence in the Douzaine, it was withdrawn.
The Douzaine discussed the report and decided to resubmit it and allow Chief Pleas to decide on the matter.
Conseiller Chris Bateson said: ""The Douzaine is aware that the subject of Sunday tractors is a contentious matter and hopes that Sark residents make their feelings known to both the committee and conseillers in general.""

In a statement the government said the animal waste processing plant prices had not increased ""for some time"" and the rise was ""considered an appropriate measure"".
But Manx National Farmers' Union secretary Sarah Comish it was ""unfair and unrealistic"" to ask farmers to cover the cost of the plant's operation.
It said the plant was ""integral"" to the industry but had produced an ""average annual net loss of just under £500,000 over the past five years"".
However, the statement said it was acknowledged the proposed increases had ""caused concern"", and the government was ""committed to continuing to engage"" with union on the issue, he said.
The infrastructure department animal waste section holds an exclusive contract to collect and dispose of dead animals from Manx farms.
Under the revised pricing structure, the charge for the collection of a bull has risen by £99.15, while the retrieval of a cow has gone up by £60.13.
Ms Comish said the hikes would be ""catastrophic"" for farmers, who were now withholding payments in protest. 
The extra charges would put an ""enormous amount of strain"" on the industry and could lead to people choosing to leave it.

Conservative councillor for Tidenham, Nick Evans, suggested the council encouraged a balanced and varied diet of food produced by local farmers and organisations.
He also proposed working with the farming community to examine opportunities to diversity their business in the interests of sustainability.
His amendment was accepted by Mr Sanders and his seconder, Patrick Kyne, who made it clear he supported the motion but is not vegan.
Trevor Roach, Green councillor for Mitcheldean, Ruardean and Drybrook, said he would support the motion after it was refined, but emphasised that working with the farming community is what it’s all about. 
“You’ve certainly kept things focused for us all,” he told farmers at the meeting. “When it comes to food it’s you lot we depend on so we need to work together.
“I fully appreciate the economic challenges the farmers have had to endure with the current trend in global trading policies that clobber farmers wherever they can. We’ve got to look at local produce for local people.”
The council voted to approve the motion by 26 votes in favour to four against with two abstentions.

,"Wet weather has wreaked havoc on food production, it has been claimed.
One of the UK's main suppliers of brassicas said its spring planting schedule was thrown into disarray, resulting in fields of rotting cabbages, broccoli and cauliflowers because crops had failed to mature in line with demand.
Meanwhile, a pick-your-own strawberry farmer from Lincolnshire said he had suffered his ""worst season in 42 years"".
Jack Ward, the chief executive of the British Growers' Association, said: ""Everybody you speak to tells you they are having an issue with the weather. Some are struggling to even get crops to germinate.""
Mr Ward added: ""There is a very fine line between success and failure in growing food. You need the right conditions, at the right time.
""Last autumn and winter, we had huge record amounts of rain. That sheer volume of water striking the ground was not good for soil structure. That has continued.
""In some instances, lack of sunshine has also had an impact on crops.""
John Moulding, commercial director at Lincolnshire-based TH Clements, a leading supplier of brassicas, said the delay in planting had led to an ""oversupply"", because crops had not matured in time to meet demand.
He said: ""We aim to plant in either the last week of February or the first week in March. However, we had to delay [planting] by two to three weeks. When we did come to plant, we weren't able to get them in the ground at the times we had set out.
""As a result, our crops matured at different times. We now have an oversupply, with fields of rotting vegetables.""
Mr Moulding said it was ""demoralising"". 
""We have people who have worked for the business for 25 years and they tell me this has been the most difficult period they can remember,"" he added.
While the firm expected to take the financial hit this year, and it was unlikely that shoppers would notice an immediate difference in prices, more wet springs would mean consumers having to pay more ""in order for businesses to be sustainable"", Mr Moulding said. 
Syston Park farm, in Grantham, Lincolnshire, plants a range of crops, including pick-your-own berries, rhubarb, asparagus, Christmas trees and pumpkins.
Owner Paul Clegg said: ""It's been the most difficult season in 42 years of growing fruit due to the combination of a late frost and cool, rainy weather.""
He added: ""At least the Christmas trees have enjoyed the rain.""
It is not surprising our weather is causing real issues for farmers up and down the country.
Our weather has always been changeable, but the recent extremes have been unprecedented.
The 18 months to March this year were the wettest 18 months ever recorded across the UK.
And the figures from Sheffield Weston park, which has one of the country’s longest data sets stretching back to 1882, highlights just how extreme it is has been.
June last year was the second warmest on record, with July the second wettest. September was then the warmest on record, followed by the wettest October and the fifth wettest December.
After a mild and wet winter, the UK then experienced its warmest spring on record, only for the first half of this summer to be the coldest this century.
And let us not forget almost exactly two years ago the country experienced extraordinary heat, with Coningsby in Lincolnshire setting a new UK record, as the country smashed through the 40C barrier for the first time.
Climate projections offer little in the way of comfort. A warmer atmosphere will hold more water vapour, and so when it rains it is likely to be heavier.
And research suggests that another implication of a warmer world will be an increasingly sluggish jet stream – suggesting longer periods of the same type of weather – leading to more droughts and floods.

,"The environment - and caring for it - continues to be a hot topic of conversation among campaigners and politicians.
Here, three people concerned about sustainable farming, the quality of our water and renewable energy tell the BBC what they want from the new Labour government.
Jon Watt farms almost 250 acres (100 hectares) near Laxfield in Suffolk. 
He has 18 head of cattle and grows wheat and barley - he also does contract work for other nearby farms which accounts for about 50% of his turnover.
He receives payments from the Sustainable Farming Incentive (SFI) which is part of the Environmental Land Management Scheme (ELMS), introduced by the previous government post-Brexit to replace EU subsidies that were linked to production and the size of the farm.
ELMS and the SFI, however, reward farmers for introducing wildlife-friendly measures such as wild flower margins for pollinators, using no insecticides and hedge planting.
SFI brings in about £13,000 of income annually for Mr Watt.
He says it is vital the scheme continues under the new government as his rotation of crops is structured around it and it forms an important part of his income.
He wants the new government to stick with the policy and fund it.
""From leaving the European Union it took about eight years to get to where we are today,"" says Mr Watt.
""We've just about got our heads around the scheme - we understand it - and it would be a really devastating thing to change it drastically now, which is where the agriculture budget itself is so important because it pays for this system.
""If we want to achieve the environmental goals they've set out, they need an agriculture budget of about £5bn to deliver that.""
A government spokesperson told the BBC that Labour was ""aiming to boost rural economic growth and Britain’s food security by introducing a new deal for farmers"".
This would include cutting through red tape in the Environment Land Management Schemes and protecting farmers from being undercut by low welfare and low standards in trade deals.
Catherine Arnold, a member of Essex-based wild swimming group Manningtree Mermaids, has long been a campaigner pressing for a clean-up of our seas and rivers.
Earlier this year, Manningtree beach in Essex, the River Cam at Sheep's Green in Cambridge and the River Stour at Sudbury in Suffolk were among 27 new sites in England to achieve 
.
It means Anglian Water could now install disinfection equipment at local sewage works to stop harmful bacteria like E-coli from being discharged into the water.
But Ms Arnold maintains more needs to be done.
She is calling on Labour to ""increase the fines to water companies - polluters - and also to withhold bonuses from executives of water companies"".
But, she also says criminal procedures should be introduced ""because the fines that they impose on the water companies are like a drop in the ocean to them"".
""The whole system has to change - what I'd really love the government to be doing is looking at a long-term solution,"" Ms Arnold says.
""The current system allows for sewage to be released into the water and then the water dilutes it - and that's the process - part of the sewage purification process - by dumping it in the water.
""We need a more holistic approach to our waterways' health - not just looking at sewage pollution but also agricultural pollution and micro-plastics. 
""I would love for the legislation to change and hold the water companies more to account.
""I'm hoping that the Labour government is going to be listening to the [people] who voted them in, and realise that the environment is massively important - our waterways are the lifeblood - it's much bigger than us just going for a swim.""
A government spokesperson told the BBC that ""the Secretary of State for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs, Steve Reed, met with representatives of 16 water companies across England and Wales last week"". 
They said companies have now signed up to the government’s initial package of reforms which includes consumers ""gaining new powers to hold water company bosses to account through powerful new customer panels"". 
""For the first time in history, customers will have the power to summon board members and hold water executives to account.""
Alicat Workboats, in Great Yarmouth, Norfolk, makes boats to ferry engineers around offshore wind farms. 
Its general manager, Simon Coote, says the new government needs to provide the sector with long-term stability - and says an improved apprenticeship scheme is also needed to tackle a skills shortage in the boat building industry.
Mr Coote says the renewables sector has transformed the business over the past 10 years or so, and maintaining boats makes up about 60% of its turnover.
Asked what he wants from the new government, he says: ""I think what we need is a long-term vision for the renewables sector to allow our customers to carry on the investment in the new infrastructure.
""Skill shortages is the other problem we have - we have a certain amount of apprentices but we end up turning work away because we haven't got enough staff.
""We have 20% apprentices and I'd like to increase that - it's just the financial restraints we have - but it's crucial for the future of the company.""
A government spokesperson told the BBC that Labour aimed to ""double onshore wind, treble solar and quadruple offshore wind by 2030 – taking action now to bring down energy bills for good and accelerate our journey to net zero"".
Regarding apprenticeships, the spokesperson said: ""We are committed to ensuring our post-16 qualifications include a range of choices that give young people the best life chances.""

,"Synthetic meat created in a laboratory “need not spell disaster to farms”, according to a new report.
Researchers from the Royal Agricultural University (RAU) spoke to over 80 farmers for a major new study.
The US State of Florida and Italy have already banned development of lab-made meat products, claiming the industry threatens traditional farming.
But British farmers told researchers from the RAU they did not see ""alternative meat"" products as a major threat.
Professor Tom MacMillan, who led the research team for the Cirencester-based RAU said: “Sure, there was a deal of concern about how it might play out, the unintended consequences for farming.
""But there was a lot of curiosity to something often seen as the enemy.
“Farmers were really engaged in the practical possibilities, supplying ingredients to the technology, maybe even hosting production units on their farms.”
Scientists have long been trying to create alternatives to popular meat products without farming live animals. 
The main reason is climate change. 
All livestock farming creates large amounts of carbon dioxide and methane, which increase climate change.
Prof MacMillan said: “The environmental cost of meat production globally means we need to throttle back, and widening the range of safe, tasty, and affordable alternatives to traditional meat can help.”
For many years the food industry had created lookalike burgers and sausages and other products using textured protein from soya, peas and other plants.
Now scientists are creating entirely synthetic proteins in the lab. 
A lab-cultured chicken product is on sale in Singapore, and tests are running on beef and lamb equivalents.
But some US states have already banned the practice, and the Italian government has outlawed synthetic meat development altogether.
""Italy is the world's first country safe from the social and economic risks of synthetic food,"" said Agriculture Minister Francesco Lollobrigida.
At face value, yes. 
If scientists and the food industry can supply all the meat-like protein we need in a factory, who needs traditional farmers? Not just livestock farmers either. 
One of the farmers who took part in the study, Dom Morris, lives on his family’s mixed farm in the Cotswolds.
“Lots of the grain grown on this farm goes into the food chain to feed animals,” he explained.
“We’d like to use some of our arable land for new animal farming, so this would have profound consequences on mixed family farms like this.”
But Prof MacMillan discovered that the threat to farming is a long way off, if it’s there at all.
“People will be eating meat, animals will be on farms like this for the rest of my life, and decades after that,” he explained.
“It’s a slow-burn risk”.
There are two types of alternatives to meat at the moment, and they both need raw materials that farmers can grow. 
The now familiar ""plant-based proteins"" found in alternative burgers, sausages, bacon and chicken products all start out as soya, peas, or other plant proteins. 
Plenty of UK farmers are supplying that industry already. 
Lab-cultured meat needs ingredients like rape meal, which is left over from oil seed rape after it has been pressed for its oil. 
Farmers like Dom Morris are investigating selling that to the cultured meat industry, turning a waste-product into a source of income.
Most surprising of all, the report found farmers considering inviting the meat-fakers onto their farms to do business. 
At the moment, the industry is small. Lab tests have been successful, but mass production has not begun in Europe yet.
Dom Morris thinks there was no reason why synthetic meat labs could not set up right inside his Cotswold barns.
He said: “We’re thinking about producing it here, on our farm, in our old Victorian farm buildings. 
""There’s the Cotswold premium at the moment, and everyone wants to know where their food comes from. 
""So why not?”

,"How Farm in Sanday has been home to seven generations of the Sinclair family.
Over that time, life on the Orkney island has changed radically and Malcolm and Jackie Sinclair have decided it’s time their farming business at How and Backaskaill farms changes hands.
, with a combined asking price of £4.2m.
“There used to be lots of little family farms, with 20 or 30 cows and some sheep. They all vanished a long time ago.” says 64-year-old Malcolm.
“When I left school at 16, we had five shops on Sanday, there were two garages to fix the machinery and tradesmen and builders based here on the island. 
""Now, we still have two good shops but we are much more dependent on goods and services coming from the Orkney mainland, and beyond.”
Changes in farming practice across rural Scotland have seen small farms amalgamated into larger farming units which are more economically viable.
Most farm jobs have been mechanised.
In the past, neighbours would often share the harvest workload together. 
Now one worker can complete more in a day than the combined effort of a whole community in the past.
In Sanday, Malcolm and his wife Jackie, 59, have been at the heart of the community, farming 400 cattle and 600 sheep and running a haulage business and a community shop.
It has been hard work, often involving 14-hour days. Their son Fraser, now 21, was the last baby born on the island. Neither of their boys now live there. 
The Sinclairs have already sold the shop and haulage businesses, and now they are leaving farming and diversifying into tourism.
“You can’t go on forever,” Malcolm said. “Our boys don’t want the farms. We’ve cut back what we are doing and now there’s a grand chance for somebody to come in and take this on.
""You can buy a lot more acres here than you can in the south, and once they are here there are plenty of opportunities.”
How Farm is on the market at £2.2m. Next door, Backaskaill Farm is offered for £2m. Between them they cover more than 1,200 acres of the island, which is famed for its dramatic sweeping beaches and crystal blue seas.
In recent years the decline in the island’s population has been halted, with many older people moving there attracted by the natural environment and relatively cheaper property prices than most places in the UK.
The latest census figures show Sanday’s population fell by 7% between 1981 and 2022. 
That slowed to just 1% over the last census period. It has now stabilised, with 491 people calling the island home in 2022.
While the numbers look positive, the age profile of the community mirrors the trend in many other island communities.
There are too few young people and residents are getting older.
In Sanday, 42% of the population are over 60 years old. Only 14% are aged between 18 and 39.
It’s a trend Prof Michael Anderson, emeritus professor of economic history at the University of Edinburgh, has found is mirrored elsewhere.
“The population of Orkney’s mainland island has been going up since 1981,"" he said.
""We all know many young islanders move away in their teens and early 20s.
""The thing that’s surprised me in the latest census results is that they start to move back around the age of 30. But they tend to move to the islands within easy commuting distance of jobs and services.
""That’s true in Orkney’s islands, and in Mull and Skye.”
Prof Anderson has found the more outlying islands such as Sanday, which is an 85-minute ferry trip from Kirkwall, Orkney’s capital, have to work harder to attract and retain a working-age population.
Sanday, with its own Junior High School educating pupils on the island up to the age of 16, is doing better than some other islands across Scotland. 
At a recent “Islands Future” event held by the Royal Society of Edinburgh in Kirkwall, Prof Anderson warned that for some of Scotland’s more remote islands, the census results indicate their population decline may already be irreversible.
Malcolm’s wife Jackie moved to Sanday from Edinburgh to take up a temporary role at the Junior High School in the 1990s.
Thirty years later, she still sees a future in the island catering for the growing tourism sector.
“We started our self-catering business out of Covid, and it's still growing,"" she said.
""We’ve recently bought two more properties and we’re developing another as high-end retreats.
""Our long-term plan is to split our time between here in Sanday and down south, closer to where our boys live.
""We’ve no plans to move away from Sanday permanently. This will always be home.”

,"A farmer from Shropshire has said the industry must adapt to changing weather patterns, following significant rainfall this year which has led to crop failure for some.
Despite sunshine making an appearance in recent days, overall the last few months have been particularly wet.
Adrian Joynt, farm manager at the Apley Estate near Bridgnorth, said prolonged spells of mild and wet weather could cause severe financial hardship for some farmers.
“The weather, for the last 12 months really, has been quite challenging,” he said.
“We are used to dealing with it, but I think this year has been exceptionally bad.”
He added: “We’ve had fields that have been waterlogged that we’ve had to replant -  so obviously that’s more work and more cost.”
Mr Joynt estimated a farmer might lose about £100 per acre for each half a tonne of wheat that could be produced on that land.
“Thankfully we’re on a large enough scale here that we can take a bit of a hit, but if we were on a smaller scale it’s very concerning.”
He said milder winters had also led to more pests surviving which might not otherwise make it through the colder months.
On top of this, less sunshine meant crops have struggled to grow as they ought to.
“I don’t want to be a doom monger because I think there’s positives to everything, but it could be the difference between profit and loss for some farms,” he said.
“With the weather we’ve had there will be a knock-on effect on yields this year.”
He said farmers in the west of Britain were more used to wetter weather conditions than those to the east, but even so it was something they would have to learn to become better at managing.
This might include things like building more shelter for animals or improving drainage systems in fields, all of which come with cost implications.
“You grow it to produce a good quality crop, and sometimes the weather doesn’t help you,” Mr Joynt said.

The area includes pasture, arable land and woodland and is an addition to the farmland and facilities the university already has in Arborfield, Shinfield and Sonning.
The university's vice-chancellor said the purchase would help ""secure the future of agriculture at Reading for the next century to come"".
The farm has been purchased to support the university's new Agrifood Futures Strategy through which it hopes to ""transform the future of food and farming"".

,"A vineyard has said it ""really needs some good weather"" in the next month or two in order to produce nice aromatic still wines.
With the first seeds planted in 1973, the Three Choirs Vineyard in Newent, Gloucestershire, is one of England's oldest vineyards, but said it has become increasingly affected by climate change.
Wine-making director, Martin Fowke, said that the type of wine they can afford to produce depends entirely on the coming weather conditions. 
""Of course we'd like some sunshine and a little bit of warmer weather, but we're very thankful that we haven't had frost,"" he said.
When a region's climate changes it can disrupt the delicate balance between sugar, acid and secondary compounds in the grapes.
This changes the rate at which they develop and can lead to differences between sweet and acidic flavours.
""We always try and make the right wines in the right year,"" said Mr Fowke. 
""Last year was a very good year for making sparkling wines because September wasn't particularly kind to us and the grapes didn't ripen that well, which is suited to sparkling.
""I'm not going to predict the weather, but this year, maybe we're in a later season and it'll get nice and warm in August and September and we'll produce some very nice aromatic still wines.""
Mr Fowke said the ""key time"" will come within the next month or so, when the grape vines start to flower.
""That's when we really need the good weather,"" he added.
Towards the end of June is when the flowering process usually takes place in English vineyards, with better pollination resulting in more fruitful bunches of grapes.
""It's very much a later season [this year], but everything's looking OK for now,"" Mr Fowke continued. 
""There's so much moisture around and the growth is so rapid that we're spending a lot of time controlling that in the vineyard.""

Dominic Hampson-Smith, 25, from Usk in Monmouthshire, said the next generation will bring a ""breath of fresh air"" to a sector where the average farmer's age is over 60. 
But the high cost of land means nearly insurmountable ""barriers"" for people trying to get into farming for the first time. 
One agricultural entrepreneur at this year's Royal Welsh Show said a tourism side-business is the only way she can continue a livestock farm in her family for generations.

A weakened Mr Modi, reliant for the first time on coalition partners, is widely expected to usher in a reset in his spending policies, while maintaining fiscal prudence.
Analysts suggest the new government may need to focus more sharply on the rural majority, who have not benefitted as much as the wealthy from the country's rapidly growing GDP.
The fact that this is Mr Modi's third term will preoccupy him with thoughts of leaving a lasting legacy and may “tempt” him to do something about economic prosperity for the masses, says Rathin Roy, a former member of the prime minister’s Economic Advisory Council.

In the 10 years that he’s been in power, Mr Modi has poured billions of dollars into state funded infrastructure, building sea bridges and expressways. He’s also undertaken tax cuts for big corporations and launched subsidy schemes to incentivise exports-focused manufacturing.
India’s shaky macro economy has stabilised and its stock markets have soared.
But so have inequality and rural distress.
BMW cars have logged their highest sales ever in the first half of this year even as overall consumption growth has been the lowest in two decades. 
Wages have stagnated, household savings have dropped and well-paying jobs remain out of reach for most Indians.
India’s regional imbalances are also stark. A majority of the country lives in northern and eastern India where per capita incomes are lower than Nepal, and health, mortality and life expectancy worse than Burkina Faso, according to Mr Roy.
Nine in 10 economists now say chronic joblessness is the biggest challenge confronting Modi 3.0. A post-election survey shows seven in 10 Indians support taxing the super-rich and eight in 10 economists believe growth has not been inclusive.
Travelling through northern India’s agrarian heartland, the fate of its rural majority sticks out in sharp contrast with those living in its cities.
Muzaffarnagar in the northern state of Uttar Pradesh is barely a few hours away from the Indian capital, Delhi. Barring the state-of-the-art highway that cuts through the expansive open fields, it feels like a region that’s been largely bypassed by the country’s shiny economic boom.
Sushil Pal’s family has tilled the plains of Behra Asa village for generations. It’s hard toil that hardly pays anymore, he told the BBC.
Mr Pal didn’t vote for Mr Modi’s party this time despite supporting it in the previous two elections. The prime minister’s promise to double farm incomes, he says, has remained just that - a promise.
“My income has gone down. The costs for inputs and labour have gone up but not for my crop,” Mr Pal said. “They only marginally increased procurement prices for cane before the elections.
“All the money I make goes in paying school and college fees for my sons. One is an engineer but hasn’t had a job for two years,” he said.
Down the road from his field, an export-focused furniture workshop has seen its turnover drop by 80% in the past five years as global orders dried up following a post-Covid sales bump.
Rajneesh Tyagi, the owner, said he would have liked to sell locally to mitigate the lull overseas, but continuing rural distress means there’s no demand for his products.
“The farm economy is down and the biggest problem in growing local demand is high debt among the farmers and unemployment,” he added. “They have no capacity to buy anything”.
Mr Tyagi’s business represents a wide universe of micro enterprises that form the backbone of India’s economy. India Ratings, a credit ratings agency, estimates 6.3 million enterprises have shut down between 2015 and 2023, costing 16 million informal jobs.
In contrast, profits reported by India’s 5,000 listed companies rose sharply by 187% between 2018 and 2023, spruced up in part because of tax cuts, according to commentator Vivek Kaul.
Bridging such gaping divides between the formal and informal parts of the economy and bringing prosperity to India’s villages will be the biggest challenges for Mr Modi as he embarks on a third term in office.
His first post-election budget may see a “tilt” towards welfarism though not necessarily a pivot away from more capital spending on big infrastructure projects, economists at Goldman Sachs said in a note.
A larger-than-expected dividend transfer from the central bank (0.3% of GDP) will enable the government to boost welfare spending and maintain capex, with a focus on rural economy and job creation, says the Wall Street bank.
Even those who manage money for some of India’s wealthiest concur with this view.
Rajesh Saluja, CEO and managing director of ASK Private Wealth, says poverty reduction will most likely be on the government’s budget agenda and it can be done “without upsetting the fiscal math”, given the strong revenues and tax collections.
But economists warn more cash handouts are a poor substitute for real reform-led development. About 800 million Indians already live on free grain and some states spend close to 10% of their revenues on welfare schemes.
The budget will have to lay out a vision for how the government plans to put millions into the workforce and create earning potential.
“The reduced footprint of the unorganised sector has implications for employment generation. Therefore, a judicious mix of policy which allows coexistence of both formal and informal sectors needs to be pursued in the interim,” says Sunil Kumar Sinha, principal economist at India Ratings.
India should also incentivise low-end, labour intensive manufacturing in sectors such as textiles and agri-food processing to address its massive domestic demand, Mr Roy says.
Economists at India’s largest bank SBI have suggested extending production-linked incentives Mr Modi has offered to exports-oriented sectors to small enterprises.
“So far, when we think of manufacturing, we are thinking of posh people. We are thinking of supercomputers. We are thinking of getting Apple to come and make a few iPhones here,” Mr Roy said. 
“These are not things that 70% of India's population consumes. We should produce in India what 70% of India's population wants to consume. If I'm able to make 200-rupee ($2.4, £1.8) shirts in this country and not let that import demand leak to Bangladesh and Vietnam, it will boost manufacturing.”
