Chuck Abbott," U.S. agriculture has turned increasingly to short-term guest workers to relieve a labor shortage in recent years. Farm groups and farm state lawmakers want to expand the program. The Republican platform does not mention agricultural workers while pledging strong immigration laws. 
, which describes itself as a blueprint for a new Trump administration, says the H-2A agricultural visa should be phased out over the next 10 to 20 years.

 Approximately 310,000 H-2A visas were issued by the State Department in 2023, up from 298,000 visas in 2022 and four times more than the 75,000 visas in 2010. Farmers say they have turned to the H-2A program because of the difficulty in recruiting farm labor. Half of farmworkers are believed to be undocumented, and many are reaching retirement age. The 275,000 H-2A guest workers of 2020 accounted for 10% of the average employment on crop farms, according to a 
.

 In March, a 
 unanimously recommended that the H-2A visa, now limited to seasonal work, also be available for year-round work on farms and in processing plants. “One thing that has become clear is the need for dairy products, meat processors, sugar processors, forestry, ranchers, and others to have access to a steady and legal workforce,” said the working group, composed of members of the House Agriculture Committee.

 Action is needed to “reform the H-2A wage system to reflect real-world wages better, while protecting against sudden wage increases that disrupt employer planning and operations,” said the working group. It suggested a wage freeze for 2025, followed by yearly increases of no more than 3.25% through 2029.

 The Trump administration proposed a two-year wage freeze for guest workers in 2020, just before the presidential election. Then Agriculture Secretary Sonny Perdue said the Labor Department regulation demonstrated “President Trump’s commitment to America’s farmers by delivering lower costs when they need it the most.” The minimum pay rates set by the Labor Department, known as adverse effect wage rates, are intended to prevent H-2A wages from undermining pay for American workers.

 Farmers frequently say the wage rates are burdensomely high. The American Farm Bureau Federation said it “supports short-term relief in the form of a justified pause in the minimum wage rate.” The H-2A program should be reformed to provide “flexibility for employers and workers by allowing employment options to address seasonal and year-round needs and a reasonable and mutually agreeable wage rate.”

 To the contrary, Project 2025 says, “The low cost of H-2A workers undercuts American workers in agricultural employment.”

 “Congress should immediately cap this program at its current levels and establish a schedule for its gradual and predictable phase-down over the subsequent 10 to 20 years, producing the necessary incentives for the industry to invest in raising productivity, including through capital investment in agricultural equipment, and increasing employment for Americans in the agricultural sector,” said Project 2025, shepherded by the Heritage Foundation. The Project 2025 chapter on the Labor Department notes the alternative argument that without guest workers, farmers would have to increase wages drastically and even then, not be certain of finding enough U.S.-born workers to bring food products to the market.

 The 16-page 
, adopted a week ago, vows “the largest deportation operation in American history” and to “sending illegal aliens back home.” Republicans say they would complete the border wall with Mexico, make border enforcement a high priority for law enforcement and the military and subject people entering the country legally to “strict vetting.” The platform endorses merit-based immigration. “We will end chain migration, and put American workers first,” it said.

 The costs, time, and disruptions involved in deporting millions of people would be enormous, said the 
. One immigration expert said it would take billions of dollars and as long as 20 years to accomplish. During Trump’s tenure in office, the United States deported 936,000 people. Congress allotted $3.4 billion this year for deportation facilities holding an average 41,500 immigrants.

 A lopsided vote on the U.S. Senate Energy and Natural Resources Committee advanced a bipartisan bill Wednesday to overhaul the process to gain federal approvals for energy projects.

 The 15-4 vote demonstrated broad support for 
, though it remains unclear if Congress will take the time in an election year to move the measure to President Joe Biden’s desk.

 Members of both parties have complained that the process of gaining permits from federal agencies for energy projects is overly complicated and lengthy, delaying clean energy and fossil fuel production alike. The bill, sponsored by West Virginia independent Joe Manchin III and Wyoming Republican John Barrasso, aims to streamline the federal permitting process.

 The bill would also require lease sales for oil and gas production in the Gulf of Mexico and lift a controversial 
 on certain liquefied natural gas exports that Biden put in place in January.

 At Wednesday’s committee meeting, Manchin, who chairs the panel, said only a bipartisan effort could effectively cure the problems with energy permitting. The bill was the product of nearly two years of negotiation that included input from a wide range of interested parties, he said.

 “We’ve listened to everyone,” Manchin said. “And I think we’ve hit it right in the middle.”

 Democrats Ron Wyden of Oregon and Mazie Hirono of Hawaii, as well as independent Bernie Sanders of Vermont, who caucuses with Democrats, voted against the measure. Republican Sen. Josh Hawley of Missouri also voted no.

 Sen. Martin Heinrich of New Mexico, who is in line to be the next top Democrat on the committee after Manchin — formerly a Democrat — retires in January, supported the bill, which could give the package momentum in the next Congress if it stalls this year.

 Heinrich said that while certain provisions would increase carbon dioxide emissions, the bill’s benefits outweigh the harms.

 “This was a carefully crafted, bipartisan, balanced bill,” he said after the vote. “All of us have things we love about it. We also have a few things that we’re not crazy about, but that’s how legislation works.”

 Republican Sen. Lisa Murkowski of Alaska sounded similar notes, saying the bill lacked some elements she wanted, but was overall a positive step.

 “I think it’s important that we demonstrate some forward movement on permitting reform,” she said. “And while this isn’t the end-all and be-all, as we’ve all acknowledged, it starts moving us forward.”

 While most Democrats on the committee supported the bill, some opposed the measure based on provisions that would benefit the fossil fuel industry. Some environmental advocates also raised that objection.

 “It’s disappointing so many senators have been duped into voting for another sweetheart deal for the fossil fuel industry in exchange for meager improvements on electricity transmission,” Brett Hartl, government affairs director at the environmental group Center for Biological Diversity, wrote in a statement.

 Wyden said he supported several parts of the bill, but could not support the entire package. The bill would counteract the 2022 law Democrats passed that offered hundreds of millions of dollars in tax credits for clean energy, Wyden said.

 Wyden praised provisions to overhaul mining standards, ease permitting for transmission lines and address geothermal energy. If the bill contained only those provisions, Wyden said he would support it and “recommend a parade down Main Street.

 “Unfortunately, there are a number of provisions in this bill that run contrary to what I think the effort in 2022 was all about, the transformative efforts,” he said.

 Wyden called for continued efforts to rework the bill before it receives a vote on the Senate floor. Other members, including those who voted to approve the bill, also called for continued tweaks.

 Murkowski, a former chair of the committee, said she was disappointed the bill did not include more on hydroelectric energy.

 Manchin told Murkowski he would continue to work with her on hydro provisions.

 Members of both parties introduced a series of amendments Wednesday. Republicans largely sought additional requirements to produce fossil fuels. Democrats sought restrictions on fossil fuel production.

 Manchin led opposition to all the amendments introduced Wednesday, saying they would throw off the bill’s careful bipartisan balance.

 “I believe that we’ve identified a reasonable compromise with our bill,” he said.

 Extreme heat reaching well into the triple digits is again on tap today from central Kansas east into southern Indiana, according to National Weather Service maps. 

 Heat indexes in central Arkansas are expected to hit 114° Fahrenheit this afternoon, the agency said. 

 About 68% of U.S. corn was in good or excellent condition as of Sunday, unchanged week to week, the Department of Agriculture said in a report. That’s still well ahead of the 57% that earned top ratings at this point a year earlier. 

 Eight percent of the crop was in the dough stage, while 41% was silking, USDA said. 

 Sixty-eight percent of the soybean crop was in good or excellent condition at the start of the week, also unchanged for a second straight week. About 55% earned such ratings during the same week last year. 

 Eighteen percent of the crop was setting pods, and 51% was blooming, the government said. 

 Analysts polled by Reuters were expecting USDA to boost its ratings for both corn and beans to 69% good or excellent. 

 Spring wheat conditions improved, rising to 77% good or excellent from 75% the previous week. That’s also up from 51% that earned top ratings a year earlier. 

 Some 76% of spring wheat was headed. 

 The winter wheat harvest continues with 71% now in the bin, up from 63% a week earlier and ahead of the prior five-year average of 62%, USDA said. 

 Corn futures for December delivery rose 4¾¢ to $4.09 a bushel overnight on the Chicago Board of Trade.

 Soybean futures for November delivery 3¾¢ to $10.44 a bushel. Soymeal gained 20¢ to $308.50 a short ton and soy oil was up 0.31¢ to 45.22¢ a pound. 

 Wheat futures for September delivery gained 3¾¢ to $5.36¼ a bushel, while Kansas City futures added 2¢ to $5.57½ a bushel. 

 Inspections of soybeans for overseas delivery declined week to week while grain assessments improved, according to the Ag Department.

 Soybean inspections for export fell to 168,593 metric tons in the seven days that ended on July 11, USDA said. That’s down from 294,209 a week earlier but topped the 160,844 tons assessed at the same point last year. 

 Examinations of corn were reported at 1.08 million tons, up from 1.02 million a week earlier, and well ahead of the 419,214 tons inspected during the same week in 2023. 

 Wheat inspections last week totaled 533,828 tons, up from 343,359 tons a week earlier and 273,443 tons at this point last year, the government said. 

 Since the start of the marketing year on Sept. 1, USDA has inspected 44.6 million metric tons of corn for export, up from 40 million tons during the same timeframe a year earlier. 

 Soybean assessments since the beginning of September now stand at 42 million tons, down from 49.9 million in the same period last year. 

 Wheat inspections since the start of the grain's marketing year on June 1 were reported at 2.27 million tons, up from 1.79 million tons at this point last year, USDA said in its report. 

 The heat wave hitting the Midwest will stick around with temperatures in the triple digits from the Texas panhandle east into southern Indiana, according to the National Weather Service.

 In southeastern Kansas, heat indexes are expected to reach 107° Fahrenheit this afternoon, the agency said in a report early this morning. 

 In south-central Missouri, values will reach as high as 109°, and parts of Arkansas will hit 114°, NWS said. 

 In central Illinois, flash flood warnings have been issued along with flood warnings and advisories as heavy storms rumbled through the area overnight. Up to 3 inches fell with another inch or so an hour coming down overnight. 

 Several rivers and streams have or will overrun their banks due to the excessive rain, the agency said.

Tony Dreibus," Wheat futures fell in overnight trading as the U.S. winter harvest rolls on and on favorable weather in growing areas worldwide.

 About 82% of the domestic winter wheat crop was in the bin at the start of the week, the U.S. Department of Agriculture said in a report. That’s up from 76% a week earlier and the prior five-year average of 80%. 

 Seventy-four percent of U.S. spring wheat was in good or excellent condition as of Sunday, down from 77% a week earlier, the agency said. That’s still well above the 42% that earned top ratings at the same point last year. 

 One percent of the crop was harvested at the beginning of the week, USDA said. 

 Last week’s three-day tour of North Dakota’s spring wheat fields showed a favorable outlook for the crop. 

 The Wheat Quality Council’s annual tour of the state showed projected yields of 54.5 bushels an acre, up from last year’s forecast for 47.4 bushels, U.S. Wheat Associates said. Durum yields are projected at 45.3 bushels an acre, up from 43.9 bushels a year earlier. 

 “After three days of analyzing, counting and calculating, participants came to a common conclusion: North Dakota wheat farmers may have produced their best crop in decades,” US Wheat said. 

 Wheat futures for September delivery lost 1½¢ to $5.22½ a bushel overnight on the Chicago Board of Trade, while Kansas City futures dropped 3¼¢ to $5.47 a bushel. 

 Corn futures for December delivery fell ¼¢ to $4.04¾ a bushel.

 Soybean futures for November delivery rose 8½¢ to $10.29¾ a bushel. Soymeal gained $3 to $321 a short ton and soy oil was up 0.24¢ to 42.14¢ a pound. 

 AGCO Corp., the maker of agricultural equipment, said second-quarter revenue fell 15% on an annual basis, citing soft market conditions and production cuts designed to reduce inventory. 

 Sales in the three months that ended on June 30 were reported at $3.25 billion, down from $3.82 billion during the same quarter a year earlier, the company said in its quarterly earnings report. 

 North American sales dropped 16% to $837.8 million and South American sales plunged 42% to $348.9 million. Sales in Europe and the Middle East (EME) lost 4.4% to $1.9 billion, and Asia Pacific sales declined 34% to $157 million. 

 In the first six months of 2024, total sales lost 14% to $6.18 billion, AGCO said. North American sales dropped 18% to $1.57 billion, South American sales were down 41% to $652.3 million, EME sales fell 1.7% to $3.63 billion and Asian sales dropped 26% to $323.7 million.

 “Softer industry sales, lower end-market demand and de-stocking efforts all contributed to lower sales [in the North American market],” the company said. “The most significant sales declines occurred in the hay equipment, mid-range, and high-horsepower tractor categories.”

 AGCO on July 25 agreed to sell most of its grain and protein business to American Industrial Partners (AIP) for about $700 million in cash. 

 Extreme heat and storms are on tap today throughout a large chunk of the Midwest, according to National Weather Service maps.

 Heat warnings and severe thunderstorm warnings have been issued from eastern New Mexico east along the Gulf Coast, and from north central Iowa south into east Texas, the maps show. 

 Indexes in eastern Nebraska and western Iowa are forecast to hit 112° Fahrenheit this afternoon. Values are forecast to reach as high as 109° in eastern Oklahoma. 

 Those working outside are advised to take precautions to avoid heat related illnesses, the agency said.

 Counties in central Iowa are seeing severe thunderstorms with winds of up to 60 mph, NWS said. Intense winds and storms are also rolling through central Illinois this morning, bringing nickel-sized hail to the area.

Tony Dreibus," Soybean futures were modestly lower in overnight trading, and grains were little changed, as investors focused on favorable weather in the U.S. Corn Belt. 

 Precipitation was expected in much of the Midwest this week, favoring parts of Minnesota, Wisconsin, and Illinois, said Don Keeney, an agricultural meteorologist with Maxar. 

 Rain is forecast for parts of the east-central Midwest today and southeastern areas Thursday, he said. 

 “Rains in southeastern areas will further improve moisture for corn and soybeans,” Keeney said. “Rain in central areas next week will maintain moisture.”

 Sixty-eight percent of U.S. soybeans were in Good or Excellent condition as of Sunday, unchanged week to week, the USDA said. Still, that’s well ahead of the 54% that earned top ratings a year earlier. 

 Twenty-nine percent of the crop were setting pods, up from 18% seven days earlier, and 65% were in bloom stage versus 51% the previous week, the USDA said. 

 Corn ratings fell to 67% Good or Excellent at the start of the week, from 68% seven days earlier, the agency said. Seventeen percent of the crop were in the dough stage, up from 8% last week, and 61% were in the silk stage, well above 41% the week prior.

 Wheat was mixed, as investors weighed improvements in Australian crop prospects against a dismal outlook in France, the European Union’s biggest producer of the grain. 

 Rainfall in southeastern New South Wales and southwestern Western Australia likely will boost prospects for wheat in the Australian states, Keeney said. 

 Moisture is expected to remain at a deficit in parts of western France, Hungary, and southern Italy, he said.

 Wheat futures for September delivery gained 2¢ to $5.44¾ a bushel, while Kansas City futures lost ½¢ to $5.66¼ a bushel. 

 U.S. egg production in June fell 2% year-over-year to 8.81 billion, the USDA said in a report. 

 The total included 7.56 billion table eggs and 1.25 billion hatching eggs, composed of 1.15 billion broilers and 96.7 million egg types, the USDA said. 

 Egg layers totaled 371 million in June, down 3% from the previous year, while production per 100 layers rose 1% to 2,377. 

 In June, broiler hatchings, which are intended for meat production, totaled 833 million, a narrow year-over-year gain. Egg type hatchings — those that lay eggs — came in at 56.7 million, a 3% decline. 

 Broiler types in incubators were reported at 736 million on July 1. Egg types in incubators rose 8% to 53.6 million, the USDA said in its report.

Chuck Abbott," After three years of study, the 
 proposed limits on salmonella contamination of raw chicken and turkey products on Monday with an emphasis on the types of salmonella bacteria mostly likely to cause illness. Consumer groups said the proposal, modeled on a 1994 USDA ban on the most dangerous types of E. coli bacteria in ground beef, was a large step forward for public health.

 “The proposal is one of the greatest advances in food safety in a generation,” said the 
. The 
 said the USDA proposal “sets safety standards where they matter to consumers; on poultry products themselves rather than on the establishments that process the birds.” The current safety system calls for processors to implement plans to avoid the contamination of poultry meat in the plant but allows sale of products containing salmonella.

 Contaminated food is the number one cause of salmonella infections in the United States, and poultry is one of the leading sources of food-borne salmonella illnesses. Although the presence of salmonella bacteria in poultry products has been declining, there has been no reduction in salmonella illnesses, said the USDA. It estimates there are 125,000 cases of salmonella illnesses related to chicken and nearly 43,000 illnesses related to turkey annually.

 “This proposed framework is a systemic approach to addressing salmonella contamination at poultry slaughter and processing, which includes enforceable standards that will result in safer food for consumers and fewer illnesses,” said Agriculture Secretary Tom Vilsack. “Far too many consumers become sick from poultry contaminated with salmonella, and today’s announcement marks a historic step forward to combat this threat.”

 Under the USDA proposal, raw whole chickens, chicken parts, ground chicken, and ground turkey products would be barred from sale if they contain 10 or more colony forming units per gram of salmonella bacteria and any amount of three disease-causing salmonella serotypes apiece for chicken and turkey.

 Poultry processors also would be required to develop a microbial monitoring program to prevent pathogen contamination during slaughter.

 Trade groups for the broiler chicken and turkey industries questioned the scientific basis for the USDA regulation and warned it might drive up costs.

 “We support changes in food safety regulations that are based on sound science, robust data, and are demonstrated to positively impact public health. We are concerned this proposal is not based on any of those,” said Ashley Peterson, in charge of regulatory affairs at the National Chicken Council, a trade group. “It also has the potential to significantly raise the price of chicken at a time when Americans are dealing with inflation in every part of their lives.”

 The 
 said USDA’s meat safety agency, the Food Safety and Inspection Service, already had the power “to drive improvements in food safety without implementing a final product standard for salmonella in turkey products.”

 In April, the USDA issued a regulation, with a one-year grace period, that would reject raw chicken as an ingredient in 
 if it contained too much salmonella. It was the first USDA rule to name salmonella as an adulterant in a class of raw poultry products.

 Americans are forecast to consume 117.1 pounds of chicken and turkey meat per person this year, slightly more than the amount of red meats they are forecasted to consume, which includes 58.2 pounds of beef and 51 pounds of pork.

Chuck Abbott," The farm bill coalition — the rural and urban alliance credited with carrying farm bills to enactment — “is a one-sided talking point,” said House Agriculture chairman 
 on Tuesday in insisting on a $53 billion increase in farm subsidies and cuts in SNAP. Time is running out for passage of the new farm bill this year, and farm groups, silent for weeks, are now calling for prompt congressional action.

 Election-year politics soon will freeze legislative progress in the already polarized House and Senate. The House was not expected to vote until after Labor Day on the farm bill that was approved by its Agriculture Committee before Memorial Day. The only hope may be passage of a House-Senate compromise bill after the Nov. 5 general elections.

 “I will not apologize for advancing a bill that seeks to put the farm back in the farm bill,” said Thompson, who combines affability with red-meat rhetoric, at a committee hearing on agricultural finances. “The romanticized ‘farm bill coalition’ often talked about is a one-sided talking point.”

 After describing Senate Agriculture chairwoman Debbie Stabenow as “a meddling Senate Democrat,” Thompson said he was open to “an informal pre-conference negotiation with the Senate” on make-up of the farm bill. Stabenow aides said Thompson proposed huge increases in farm spending without paying for it and bill unduly favors Southern growers over farmers in the Midwest and Plains.

 Stabenow has said she will not accept cuts in SNAP or removal of “guardrails” on climate funding; both are goals of House and Senate Republicans. She has proposed increases of at least 5% in so-called reference prices for major crops. The House bill and a Senate Republican “framework” call for an average 15% increase.

 “A farm bill is not passed through slogans and posturing,” said Stabenow’s office. “The path to passing a bipartisan farm bill has always been holding together the broad farm and food coalition that has formed the foundation of every successful bill for decades.”

 At the House hearing, Thompson said his committee-approved farm bill “represents the largest permanent investment in the farm safety net, conservation, trade promotion, specialty crops, research, and livestock biosecurity in more than two decades.”

 Republicans would foolishly restrict USDA access to emergency funds at the same time their nominee for the White House, former president Donald Trump, might start a new trade war, said Georgia Rep. 
, the senior Democrat on the House Agriculture Committee. The Trump administration tapped the USDA fund for $23 billion in aid to farmers during the Sino-U.S. trade war.

 “Bottom line, if we want to get a farm bill done this year, as these witnesses want, we have to find a different way to pay for it without locking away this important tool for five years,” said Scott.

 “My door remains open to negotiation from any partner willing to come to the table with a serious proposal, not more red lines,” said Thompson. Scott said he was willing to work on bipartisan improvements to the farm bill, “But you must be open to change.”

 Farm Belt witnesses described extreme financial stress from high production costs and multi-year decline in commodity prices. Minnesota crop and dairy farmer Dana Allen-Tully said a farm bailout package may be needed because farmers cannot make a profit at current market prices for corn and soybeans. North Carolina cotton farmer David Dunlow said “another straight extension of the current farm bill is unacceptable….many farmers like me and others across the country will not be farming next year without some sort of assistance.”

 “Bankers believe they may be ‘looking over a cliff’ in regard to the agricultural economy without changes to current government policy,” said Tony Hotchkiss, of the American Bankers Association. “This includes adjustments to reference prices and ensuring that crop insurance covers loss appropriately for producers.”

 USDA forecasts of 
, an indicator of profitability, are more sanguine. Net income was a record $185.5 billion in 2022 and is forecast at $116.1 billion this year, a steep decline but still the fourth-highest net income on record and 15% above its 10-year average. The debt-to-asset ratio would rise slightly this year to 12.8%, a moderate level. The USDA was scheduled to update its forecast on Sept. 5.

 Current levels of futures contracts suggest that appropriate budgeting prices for 2024 crops production are $4.00 per bushel for corn and $10.50 per bushel for soybeans.

 Those prices would result in low returns in 2024, far lower than the last low-price period from 2014 to 2019. Much higher costs cause lower 2024 returns. Those budget price forecasts could change with unforeseen events, as does occur in agriculture. Over the next several months, estimates for returns and incomes will solidify. Still, it seems prudent to plan for much lower prices.

 Expectations generally have been for much lower corn and soybeans prices in 2024 compared with the 2021 to 2023. In February, the projected price used to set guarantees on crop insurance was set at $4.66 per bushel for corn. The projected price is the average of February settlement prices of the December corn traded on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange (CME) and represents an unbiased indicator of prices at harvest. The $4.66 projected price is well below the $5.90 projected price for 2022 and $5.91 for 2023.

 Since February, the December CME futures contract has fallen, currently trading near $4.10 per bushel (see Figure 1). This decline in price is consistent with a growing belief that yields in the U.S. will be above trend. Moreover, no significant market surprises have occurred that would either reduce supply or increase demand. In other words, a good supply of corn and roughly stable demand are leading to lowered price expectations.

 The current December futures price for corn is consistent with cash prices below $4.00 at harvest, roughly $3.80 per bushel. Given usual price patterns, one expects cash prices to increase over the marketing season, and an average cash price of $4.00 per bushel for 2024 production seems reasonable.

 A $4.00 price is well below recent prices. USDA reports the national market year average (MYA) price at $6.00 for 2021 and $6.54 for 2022. The 2023 marketing year will end in August, with a current forecast of $4.65 per bushel. If a $4.00 price occurs for 2024, it would be the lowest since 2019, when the market year average price was $3.56 per bushel.

 Futures markets are currently suggesting roughly similar prices for 2025 for corn. The December 2025 futures contract is trading near $4.60, indicating that cash corn prices at harvest in 2025 could be in the low $4.30 range.

 A similar story exists for soybeans. The 2024 projected price for soybeans is $11.55 per bushel, well below projected prices in 2022 ($14.33) and 2023 ($13.76). November futures prices have fallen since February, now trading near $10.20 per bushel. Cash price at harvest below $10 per bushel are likely, with an overall 2024 MYA price of $10.50 being an appropriate projection. Futures prices suggest continuing low prices into 2025, with a $10.80 price being an appropriate projection for the 2025 MYA price.

 Current markets are pointing to corn prices averaging near $4.00 per bushel and soybeans prices averaging near $10.50 per bushel over the next several years. Overall, the higher prices from 2021 through 2023 appear transitory, and prices are now moving to lower levels (see 
, 
). We may be again entering a period of lower prices like that from 2014 through 2019. From 2014 to 2019, central Illinois farmers received an average price of $3.64 per bushel for corn and $9.69 for soybeans.

 Current market price indicators of $4.00 per bushel for corn and $10.50 for soybeans are above the 2014 to 2019 averages. Still, return levels likely will be much lower than from 2014 to 2019 because of higher costs. According to Illinois Farm Business Farm Management (FBFM) data, non-land costs for corn averaged $587 per acre from 2014 to 2019 (see Revenue and Costs for Illinois Grain Corps 
). Those non-land costs increased to a projected $772 per acre, an increase of $185 per acre. Non-land costs for soybeans increased from an average of $363 per acre in 2014 to 2019 to a projected $512 per acre in 2024, an increase of $149 per acre. Cash rents increased from an average of $277 per acre from 2014 to 2019 to a projected $359 per acre in 2024, an increase of $82 per acre.

 We revised prices and yields in the central Illinois high-productivity budgets (see

) to reflect lower prices, higher yields, and some Price Loss Coverage (PLC) and Agriculture Risk Coverage (ARC) payments. Corn prices were lowered from $4.50 per bushel to $4.00 per bushel (see Table 1). Growing conditions have been good across Illinois, leading to an increase in yield from 227 bushels per acre to 234 bushels per acre. Soybean prices are reduced from $11.30 per bushel to $10.50 per bushel, while yields are increased from 72 bushels per acre to 75 bushels per acre. Also included are $5 of PLC/ARC payments. If those payments occur, they will be received in October 2025. Based on current crop conditions, crop insurance payments likely will be minimal in 2024. We also added $5 per acre to reflect modest crop insurance payments. On revenue products, lower prices likely will be offset by higher yields.

 Those changes cause farmer returns from cash rent farmland to decrease. For corn, farmer return decreases from -$100 per acre to -$185 per acre. Soybean returns decrease from -$57 per acre to -$74 per acre. Most of central Illinois is in a 50% corn and 50% soybean rotation, leading to an overall net farmer return of -$129 per acre on cash rented land.

 A -$129 per acre return would be the lowest since comparable records began in 2000. Over the entire 2000 to 2023 period, farmland returns averaged $90 per acre, but there is a great deal of variability across years. High return periods occurred

 Negative returns occurred after both high-price periods. Returns were -$3 in 2013 and -$10 in 2015. The 2014 projected returns are more negative at -$129 per acre.

 Some unanticipated events could increase prices, as happens in agriculture. As a reminder of possibilities, corn prices were approaching $3.00 per bushel in the summer of 2020, the beginning of the COVID pandemic. Then, a Derecho storm hit central Iowa in August, extending into northern Illinois, taking the top end off of U.S. yields. It also became evident that the China swine herd was being rebuilt after being severely impacted by African Swine Fever. Those two events began a period of higher prices, which were further fueled by the Ukraine-Russia conflict and lackluster yields across the world. Something similar could happen in late 2024, but those events are difficult to anticipate and seem unlikely.

 The federal government could institute an ad hoc disaster assistance program. A continuation of the Economic Relief Program (ERP) seems likely, given its prevalence in recent years (see 
, 
). Essentially, ERP offers a top-up of the coverage level of crop insurance. However, those programs likely will not fill the gap. Like crop insurance, ERP protects against within-year declines in revenue. One of the income issues now is the decline in price over the years. For example, the projected cost for corn fell from $5.91 to $4.66. An extension of the ERP program will do nothing to cover this $1.25 fall in price. An alternative ad hoc disaster assistance program could arise. It is, after all, an election year.

 Budgeting for $4.00 corn and $10.50 soybean prices seems appropriate for 2024. Slightly higher price expectations – $4.30 for corn and $10.80 for soybeans – are accurate estimates of market-driven estimates for 2025. Using these prices will result in negative returns for most cash-rented farms. Depending on a farm’s debt position, owned farmland could still provide positive cash flows. Returns and farm income will come into clearer focus in the next several months.

 Most farm operations have strong financial positions, with relatively low debt and high working capital (see 
, 
, 
, 
, and 
). However, the low returns that are expected will quickly erode that position, particularly the working capital position. Some farms may need to make changes to their operations to avoid severe losses of liquidity.

 The price and return outlook suggest downward adjustments in cash rental rates. However, cash rents typically have lags in moving downward when prices fall. Still, the severity of income declines may dictate that cash rents will come down for specific tracts, particularly it the farms operating those tracts currently have lower working capital levels.

 Some have suggested that farming is a boom to bust business. Long periods of low incomes like those from 2014 to 2019 need to be survived to gain financial resources from higher price and income periods like those in 2021 and 2022. We may have now entered another extended period of low prices again. Time will tell.

Farmdoc," 


 With the USDA cancelling its regularly scheduled July cattle inventory report due to budget cuts, a question that many would like to have answered is: How big is the U.S. cattle herd?

 Fortunately, historical relationships between changes in prior and subsequent inventories and levels of cow slaughter in between or heifers’ share of cattle on feed offer some indication. These negative relationships respectively explain 30% and 50% of the variation in changes in cattle inventory from one July to the next. While the share of January cow inventory that is slaughtered by July has dropped from 8.75% in 2003 to 7.76% in 2004, suggesting a slowing of cow herd liquidation, the current level still corresponds to a reduction in the July over July total inventory, as does the proportion of feedlot cattle that are heifers, currently at 39.6% compared to 39.9% last July.

 A model incorporating both variables explains 61% of inventory changes and estimates the July 1 U.S. cattle inventory to be 94.2 million head or 1.2% lower than in July 2023.
 Hence, it appears the U.S. cattle industry overall remains in a contractionary phase, even if there may be regional pockets of expansion.

 The USDA’s most recent Cattle on Feed report indicates that feedlots placed 1.56 million head on-feed and marketed 1.79 million last June or about 7% fewer placements and 9% fewer marketings than in the prior June, bringing the July 1 total number of cattle on feed to 11.3 million head or just about 1% more than last July.

 With a 0.8% increase in steers on-feed relative to last July and a nearly unchanged (0.1% increase) number of heifers, the latter’s share of cattle on feed, as already mentioned, also remains similar to a year ago at nearly 40%, as compared to only 31%-33% during much of the last expansion. Such a statistic typically indicates a reduction in replacement heifers, as producers remain reluctant to rebuild the breeding herd.

 Given the low inventory and cattle on feed numbers, beef production is anticipated to be 1.1% lower in 2024 than last year and then drop another 4.5% in 2025. Accordingly, per capita beef consumption is expected remain near 58 pounds per person in 2024 and then decrease 3.26% to 56.3 pounds per person in 2025. Based on stronger than anticipated global demand, the USDA in its Livestock, Dairy, and Poultry Outlook revised projections of beef exports upward, now just 4.3% lower this year than the last and left unchanged a further 14.0% projected decline for 2025.

 Following records in 2021 and again in 2022, beef exports dropped about 14.3% lower in 2023, and the 2024 projection returns to within 1.5% of the 2020 level, while projected declines for 2025 bring beef exports down to levels not seen since 2016. Still, as a result of currently strong demand and declining production, cold stocks of beef are already fairly low. According to the USDA’s June Cold Storage Report beef stocks on May 31 are down 3.4% from a month earlier and 0.5% from last year.

 All things considered, prices are likely to remain above year ago levels. Quarterly prices for slaughter steers are forecast to average about $191.48/cwt and $199.08/cwt for the last two quarters of 2024, and $204.60/cwt and $209.12/cwt for the first two quarters of 2025. For 600-700 pound feeder steers, prices are forecast to average about $286.38/cwt and $277.88/cwt for the last two quarters of 2024, and $293.31/cwt and $301.50/cwt for the first two quarters of 2025.

 These projections reflect tight supplies and declining but resilient domestic consumption and export demand. If demand declines even more than anticipated or a larger herd exists than indicated by this analysis, then lower prices may result.

Noah Rohlfing," At the end of May, Tennessee crops and soil were faring well, after a wet spring season. However, June and July have been different. Rapid-onset drought has hit much of central and eastern Tennessee, as high temperatures collided with a stop to regular rainfall. 

 According to data from the Iowa Environmental Mesonet, June 1–July 23, areas of central Tennessee experienced upwards of 5 inches less precipitation than the yearly average. 

 In the latest Drought Monitor report released July 25, 48.3% of the state is in D1 moderate drought or worse — a jump of 47 percentage points from April. Corn crop condition has also worsened; the most recent USDA Crop Progress report indicates that as of July 21, 51% of the state’s corn are in Good/Excellent condition — down from 56% the week prior.

 Soybeans are in 58% Good/Excellent condition — down from 62% the week prior.

 Tennessee Assistant State Climatologist William Tollefson said the sudden uptick in drought has been difficult on corn and pastures. 

 “The grasses were all brown, trees were showing signs of stress,” Tollefson says. “We got reports of cattle issues, like pastures, having to feed hay and bring in water. Some farmers were selling calves to reduce stress on their pastures.” 

 Corn was the other concern. “In certain counties, the drought hit right as tasseling was starting,” Tollefson says. “They were starting to silk. We had a report from one extension agent that the silks were turning black immediately because it was so hot and dry.”

 Hay has been impacted heavily. State Climatologist Andrew Joyner says there have been reports of calves being sold off in numbers above the yearly average due to a lack of viable hay. In Smith County, east of Nashville, he says, a reported 1,214 head were sold as of July 13 — a near-doubling of the 802 head sold in July 2023. 

 Pasture conditions in the latest Crop Progress report were only 24% Good/Excellent, with 42% of pastures rated as Poor/Very Poor. 

 Difficulties in the livestock and crops have left much of Tennessee wishing for consistent rains. 

 The National Weather Service Climate Prediction Center’s short-term forecast for the end of July and beginning of August expects above-average precipitation for Tennessee. The August monthly prediction indicates the same. Temperatures are forecast to continue to be high.

 “It seems like our pattern is shifting,” Joyner says.

 Tollefson and Joyner say Tennessee would need immense precipitation to emerge from drought conditions. Steady rainfall for for multiple days per week over a long period would be preferable to intense rainfall. That would help pastures and fields recover to pre-drought conditions.

 In the long term, Joyner says farmers are hoping for tropical moisture to come through in August, September, and October — which didn’t happen in 2023. 

 “Usually, they’re pretty helpful for us,” Joyner says. “Last year we didn’t have any. We are really hoping for some tropical moisture later into the fall to help during the end of the growing season and toward harvest season.”

Luis Vieira," Estimates for Brazil’s corn output continue to shrink. The total corn output is down 1.41 million metric tons (mmt) to 147.3 mmt, according to Brazil’s National Supply Company (Conab). This is 12.2% lower than last year’s output. The second corn crop was down 3.4% from the previous forecast to 88 mmt.

 The drop in production is attributed to a year with “intensified El Niño with an influence over the crops since the early plantings,” according to Conab.

 Harvest of safrinha — the second corn crop — is underway. In Mato Grosso, the largest corn producing state, harvest is 76% complete with 45% of the new crop sold, according to consultancy AgRural. Favorable weather has helped spur harvest along. This has not been the case in Mato Grosso do Sul where harvest is only 29% complete.

 In Paraná, the only southern state that plants safrinha, many regions have gone 40 days without rain, according to a local government agency. Harvest is underway with 66% complete and 21% of the crop is considered under poor conditions. 


 Rain is in the forecast for this week in Paraná, according to Climatempo. West-central states, such as Mato Grosso, Mato Grosso do Sul, and Goiás, may face storms, which could mean multiple harvest delays this week.


 The main talking point in the market among producers is the currency devaluation and its impact on the price received by producers. On July 12, 1 U.S. dollar would buy 5.42 Brazilian real. In January, $1 could purchase 4.95 Brazilian real.


 While the amount received in local currency has increased due to currency devaluation, fertilizer costs are down, reducing the amount spent on inputs.


 Argentina has finished soybean harvest with final production at 50 mmt. 


 Estimates for corn harvest remain at 46.5 mmt, according to the Buenos Aires Cereal Exchange. Harvest continues to progress well with 70% complete. 


 Wheat planting in Argentina is almost complete with 93% done and 97% of that in good or excellent condition, according to the Buenos Aires Cereal Exchange.

Mariah Squire," Brook Duer is a staff attorney at the Penn State Center for Agricultural and Shale Law. Starting in private practice in Lancaster County and representing clients in agriculture, he made his way to the Pennsylvania Department of Agriculture, where he was chief counsel for most of his tenure.


 Duer spoke with Successful Farming
 magazine about what drew him into the law field, how he gained an impressive understanding of HPAI and related regulations during the 2014–15 outbreak, and some advice for farmers during the current outbreak. 


 BD: I decided to go to law school because I was, believe it or not, in a rock and roll band, and the manager of the band was in law school himself. He kind of talked me into it. I went to the University of Pittsburgh Law School, and then when I got out, I was looking to get away from the city. Lancaster County in Pennsylvania [west of Philadelphia] had an opening. 

 I got into private practice, and you can’t really be in a town like this without representing agriculture clientele in various forms. I really enjoyed understanding a bit more about how people make a living in this industry and all of the moving parts. 


 Around 2007 I went up to the Department of Agriculture, and I became the chief counsel there in short order. I worked there for 12 years, and eight of those years I was the chief counsel. 


 It was such a great education. If I had known the interesting aspects of being an in-house attorney for an agricultural regulator, I probably would’ve done it a lot earlier. That was just an eye-opening experience, a great 12 years.


 When you’re outside of government, you don’t always see how hard some people work at it and how much they put into it. That really did kind of turn my head around, you know? This is a worthwhile endeavor, from the government standpoint, to try to make these programs work better, try to make things happen in the best possible way for farmers and other agriculture stakeholders.


 I came in from the outside, not being a longtime government lawyer. Luckily, when I got there, I had a good staff who had experience. I just picked up everything I could from these people. 


 When you’re in private practice, people expect you to get a result. That’s what they’re paying you for. I think that was something I brought from the outside. In government I tried to just apply the same thing, which is, if they brought me into this, then they expect me to achieve something.


 BD: In Pennsylvania at that time, we were obviously concerned about the spread east, toward us. Like most of the Mid-Atlantic portion of the country, we have very high numbers in terms of poultry production, so we were watching very intently. 


 Everybody was doing the same thing, which was learning how USDA was handling all of the big questions, whether it was how do you dispose of carcasses or how you do the depopulation — what’s working, what’s not working. We were also very intently watching the relationship of USDA with farmers.


 We were very intent on trying to make sure that this went well, if it ever happened here. We used to have a lot of these tabletop exercises where we would do simulations and start to learn the processes. 


 When you are in agriculture, you understand the major animal diseases. You understand on paper what these are, but you don’t necessarily have firsthand experience with them. Very few people do. But the 2014–15 outbreak gave some people firsthand experience, and it gave others a chance to watch that. It certainly improved everybody’s understanding of what you do, and it improved the USDA’s and [the agency's Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service] operations immensely.


 In the federal system, animal disease control is a highly technical little niche. Animal disease control, when you work at the state level, is much more visible, and the gravity of it, I think, becomes more real. If this part of your state department of agriculture doesn’t work well or doesn’t have the resources to function at its ideal capacity in times of crisis, then that’s not a good situation for the state.


 BD: Absolutely nothing, to be honest with you. I remember walking in, and the gentleman who was the chief counsel before me gave me some orientation to a few things. He handed me this avian influenza pandemic emergency plan. I had this vague memory of avian influenza having some ability to cross over to people, but I really didn’t have any kind of firm foundation and understanding. I really opened the books and started understanding what was going on in 2014. I was there from 2007 to 2014 before I really had to get into it.


 I was always fascinated by the amount of authority that was given to the state veterinarians and the animal health personnel under our state law to do things immediately by orders. Quarantine orders can be quite expansive and burdensome, so it’s quite interesting to watch that kind of authority be used judiciously. 


 You watch the level of expertise from the regulatory people, veterinarians, and others — you get a new respect for the depth of their knowledge. It takes many minds to put together these quarantine orders. 


 When you first get into government as a lawyer, you want to live a bit by the premise of “Why do you do it that way?” It’s good to push your people to examine why something is done a certain way, and “Just because we always did it that way” isn’t the answer. You have to think further than that. 


 But then, on the other hand, you gain a new respect for why it’s done that way. When you start getting into things as drastic as quarantine orders, you start to realize that because it’s always been done that way — has history to it — it’s a history worth figuring out before you change it. 


 In the course of all of these HPAI measures that are being taken, we have not had any standoffs where people aren’t letting the USDA officials in or they aren’t listening. I’m amazed at how civil this has been done — the quarantine orders and other measures — since 2014. There’s been cooperation. Rationality has won out in the execution of these disease control measures, which is something to be very thankful for. 


 
BD: Your animal health veterinarian staff, whether it’s your state staff, or your USDA staff in this particular instance, are some of your greatest assets. Gain as much knowledge from these people as you can while you’re around them, because it’ll help you think about the problems better in the future. 


 Try to look at their perspective and understand why things are the way they are, and then have a discussion about it. Learning from all of these professionals that are in this field and have been in this field for a long time is so key to this.

 that “production capacity of sustainable aviation fuel in the United States could jump by 1400% in 2024 if all announced capacity additions come on line, the U.S. Energy Information Administration said on Wednesday.”

 “The EIA anticipates domestic production of (other) biofuels will increase by about 50% in 2024, led by rising SAF production,” Reuters reported. “…The EIA projects that SAF output will rise from 2,000 (barrels per day) to nearly 30,000 bpd in 2024.”

 Other biofuels, according to the EIA, includes sustainable aviation fuel (SAF), renewable heating oil, renewable naphtha, renewable propane, renewable gasoline, and other emerging biofuels that are in various stages of development and commercialization.

 
 that “Phillips 66’s Rodeo facility in California reached its renewable fuel production target of 50,000 bpd in June, of which 10,000 bpd is SAF. Valero’s Diamond Green project, in partnership with Darling Ingredients, at its Port Arthur, Texas refinery is expected to come online in the fourth quarter of this year and produce 15,000 bpd of SAF by the end of 2024.”

 “Investments in SAF have increased due to the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency’s Renewable Fuel Standard (RFS), federal tax credits, and state programs and tax credits incentivizing use of the fuel,” 
. “The White House also set a goal of meeting 100% of U.S. aviation fuel demand with SAF by 2050. About 1.6 million b/d of petroleum jet fuel was consumed in the United States in 2023, and we project U.S. jet fuel demand in 2050 to exceed 2.0 million b/d in our 2023 Annual Energy Outlook.”

 
 “that its projections for a tripling of Sustainable Aviation Fuels (SAF) production in 2024 to 1.9 billion liters (1.5 million tonnes) are on track. This would account for 0.53% of aviation’s fuel need in 2024.”

 “Renewable fuel production is shared by many industries and SAF is a part of renewable fuel production. That is why increasing the production of renewable fuel is key to increasing the potential of SAF,” the IATA said. “Some 140 renewable fuel projects with the capability to produce SAF have been announced to be in production by 2030. If all of these proceed to production as announced, total renewable fuel production capacity could reach 51 million tonnes by 2030, with production capacity spread across almost all regions.”

 “In December 2023 IATA reported that some 69 million tonnes of renewable fuel capacity were expected to be available by 2028. The most recent estimate is for 51 million tonnes of renewable fuel capacity to be available in 2030, based on currently announced projects,” 
. “Several factors have resulted in this reduced estimate. Most significant was an evaluation of projects against more stringent criteria for success and for the potential to meet SAF’s exacting sustainability criteria. Additionally, some projects have progressed at a slower pace towards commercial operations. With the right incentives, the potential for international aviation to reach a 5% reduction in carbon emissions by 2030 through SAF remains, provided policies are in place to increase the share of renewable fuel production allocated to SAF.”

 The percentage of corn at the silking stage in the Buckeye State jumped significantly since the last Crop Progress report and was also far ahead of historical averages. As of July 28, 81% of the state’s corn crop had reached the silking stage, an increase of 21 percentage points since the week prior. Last year at this time, only 54% of the state’s corn was at the silking stage. Further, the five-year average is just 60%.


 A quarter of Ohio’s corn had reached the dough stage as of July 28. With 25% of the corn crop at the dough stage, that’s a jump of 12 percentage points compared to the week prior. Last year at this time, just 2% of the state’s corn had reached the dough stage, and the five-year average for Ohio is only 9%. 


 As far as corn condition, two-thirds of Ohio’s corn crop was in good shape or better, and only 5% was rated very poor or poor the week ending July 28. The specific breakdown of corn conditions was 1% very poor, 4% poor, 29% fair, 55% good, and 11% excellent.

 Despite great numbers for corn progress and condition, weather conditions in Ohio are causing some concern. State Statistician Ben Torrance of the USDA NASS Ohio Field Office said that dry conditions were beginning to worry farmers. That’s according to the Ohio Crop Weather report released July 29. 


 The most recent U.S. Drought Monitor report showed that over 72% of the state was abnormally dry or worse as of July 30. Further, nearly 40% of the state was experiencing at least moderate drought conditions, and almost 14% of the state was experiencing severe drought conditions.


 Pickaway County is one of the areas experiencing the worst of the drought conditions. According to the U.S. Drought Monitor, over 99% of the county was in a severe drought as of the week ending July 30, and it’s been that way since the week ending July 16. What’s more, the whole county has seen at least moderate drought conditions since the week ending July 2.


 Brenna Gibson, who farms alongside her husband H.L. in Pickaway County, shared that they don’t expect the bumper crop they had last year by any means. “This year is extremely dry. Last year was a great crop year.”


 The particular area Gibson’s farm is located is a particularly dry area in the first place, she said. Even crops just a bit north or south of them are greener than their own. “When [we] farm, it’s almost like a gamble because we don’t have those timely rains like some areas do,” Gibson said.


 In 40 years of farming together, this isn’t the first time the Gibsons have faced growing seasons that are more challenging than the norm. “We’ve gone through this before, and we’ve weathered the storm before … we’ll get through it,” she said. Ultimately, Gibson’s attitude is to “hope for the best always” and she expressed a hopeful dependence on God to provide, saying, “He always does, even in the lacking times.”

 that “record-high wheat yields in North Dakota are set to further expand American grain supplies and should help to quell inflation for foods like bagels, where prices had recently started rising again.”

 “Dozens of wheat traders, millers and bakers fanned out across the state in an annual crop tour this week,” Hirtzer reported. “They found lush wheat fields — thick with tall, green plants. Farmers enjoyed a speedy spring sowing season and ample rainfall in May and June, before a recent turn to hot and dry weather.”

 “The primary variety grown in the state of hard red spring wheat should yield 54.5 bushels per acre, according to the tour’s final data Thursday,” Hirtzer reported. “That’s up 15% from last year and just below the US Department of Agriculture’s projection earlier this month of 56 bushels per acre — the highest ever. The tour estimate would also mean the state’s highest yield ever.”

 
 that “U.S. all-wheat production for 2024/25 is forecast at 2,008 million bushels, the largest wheat crop since 2016/17. Production is up 134 million bushels from the previous month and 11 percent higher than the previous year.”

 “Larger production for Hard Red Winter (HRW) and Hard Red Spring (HRS) are the major factors driving the year-to-year increase in total wheat production, while smaller increases are seen for White and Durum. Soft Red Winter (SRW) is down from the previous year’s bumper crop,” Sowell wrote. “Stronger U.S. supplies this year are expected to make U.S. wheat more competitive on the global market, contributing to higher exports. Total U.S. exports are forecast at 825 million bushels, the largest since 2020/21.”

 
 that “the Wheat Quality Council’s Hard Winter Wheat Tour concluded Thursday, May 16, in Manhattan, Kansas. After three days, scouting 449 fields across the state and some into neighboring Nebraska and Oklahoma, the total weighted average yield for hard winter wheat was estimated at 46.5 bushels per acre (bpa), a 55% increase from 2023.”

 “Last year, the average yield estimate for the 2023 winter wheat tour was 30.0 bpa,” Jenkins reported. “Based on May 1 conditions, Kansas’s 2024 winter wheat crop is forecast at 268 million bushels, up 33% from last year’s crop, according to USDA National Agricultural Statistics Service. Average yield is forecast at 38.0 bpa, up 3 bushels from last year.”

Bigger stockpiles and cheaper grain are welcomed by food manufacturers who had been struggling with years of reduced US plantings and the record-high prices that followed Russia’s invasion of Ukraine in 2022. Just a year ago, wheat was coming to the US from Poland to make up for a shortfall.”

 “Still, prices for foods made from the staple grain are still relatively expensive. Earlier in July, the US Labor Department said its food index climbed amid gains in the baked-goods category even as broader inflation pressures were easing,” Hirtzer reported. “Wheat growers are also facing lower farm-gate prices even as costs for seeds, chemicals and equipment have stayed high.”

 Weather woes in some growing areas globally are underpinning futures. 

 Ukraine said its corn and sunflower harvests may fall by 35% due to hot weather and drought.

 “Productive moisture reserves are extremely low,” the Ukrainian Agri Council said in a statement. “Despite the fact that the temperature is expected to drop, the lack of precipitation will negatively affect the development of these crops.”  

 The country’s corn crop is starting to bloom and a lack of precipitation could lead to a “critical” situation, the council said. 

 About 15% to 30% of corn from Romania was “burned” by heat this year, leading to a reduction in global supplies, the report said. 

 In Canada, limited rains and elevated temperatures in parts of Alberta and Saskatchewan will increase stress on spring wheat, said Don Keeney, an agricultural meteorologist with Maxar. 

 Moisture in southern growing areas of Brazil is forecast to decline amid drier weather later this week, the forecaster said.

 Exporters of agricultural products from the U.S. may have a new customer in mind, one that most wouldn’t think as a destination: Venezuela. 

 The country was the sixth-biggest importer of U.S. agricultural products in South America last year, importing $670 million worth of goods, USDA said in an attaché report from its Caracas office. While that's down 10% year over year, growth opportunities abound. 

 “Venezuela continues to grow its retail sector, supermarkets are well stocked, and U.S. brand awareness and acceptance have increased over the last two years,” the report said. 

 Agricultural imports by the South American country have the potential to improve moving forward, and the U.S. is well positioned due to product pricing, quality, and geographical proximity, USDA said. 

 U.S. companies stand to benefit from the popularity of products from the States and a “de facto dollarization of the Venezuelan economy,” the agency said. More than 60% of the country’s food is derived from imports and shipments from the U.S. can arrive in three to five days, a much shorter timeframe than other suppliers. 

 Still, there are challenges: Venezuela has trade agreements with countries in South and Central America, inflation and devaluation have hurt consumer purchases, and the country’s processes for permitting and registering certain ag or food items can be cumbersome, USDA said. 

 Flood warnings and watches have been issued for parts of southern Missouri, southern Illinois and northern Arkansas, according to the National Weather Service. 

 Storms are forecast in the region this morning with some producing large hail and winds up to 60 mph, the agency said. 

 As much as 5 inches of precipitation fell in the overnight hours and another 1 to 3 inches of rain are expected per hour this morning. Flooding is ongoing in some areas. 

 In the southern Plains, strong storms are likely this afternoon, mostly in the western Texas and Oklahoma panhandles, NWS said. 

 Thunderstorms are possible every day through Monday. Stronger storms may develop in the region on Friday and Saturday, the agency said.

 Tens of thousands of farmers or would-be farmers who say they suffered discrimination when they applied for assistance from the U.S. Department of Agriculture will get one-time payments that total about $2 billion from the federal government.

 “While this financial assistance is not compensation for anyone’s losses or pain endured, it is an acknowledgement,” U.S. Agriculture Secretary Tom Vilsack said Wednesday in a call with reporters.

 The payments are the result of a program — the Discrimination Financial Assistance Program — created by the Inflation Reduction Act of 2022 that was meant to aid farmers, ranchers and forest landowners. President Joe Biden said it was the result of his promise “to address this inequity when I became president.”

 The USDA received more than 58,000 applications from people who claimed discrimination based on race, color, national origin, sex, sexual orientation, gender identity, religion, age, marital status, disability and retaliation for “civil rights activity.”

 Vilsack could not immediately say what type of discrimination was most often indicated by the applicants, but the bulk of the payments went to farmers in southern states with higher percentages of Black residents.

 Payments 
 to people in every state and three of its territories, but residents of Alabama and Mississippi alone received almost half of the money. There were 30 people in Iowa who are set to receive a total of about $4 million.

 More than 43,000 people will be paid, Vilsack said. The payments range from $3,500 to $500,000, depending on the circumstances and effects of the discrimination.

 The department could not immediately supply a summary of those claims, but Vilsack said the discrimination resulted in loan denials, loan delays, higher interest rates and an overall lack of assistance.

 “We’ve made significant strides in breaking down barriers to access, and my hope is that people will begin to think differently about USDA, so that we can better serve all who want to participate in agriculture in the future,” Vilsack said.

 Specifically, Vilsack said the department’s Farm Service Agency, which administers farm loans, now has a more diverse leadership and loan assessment processes that rely less on human discretion.

FERN's Ag Insider," An additional worker became infected with the H5N1 avian flu virus while culling sick hens at a Colorado egg farm, say 
, raising the U.S. total of infected workers to 11, all with mild symptoms. Eight of the cases, seven involving poultry and one involving dairy, have occurred in Colorado.

 The Centers for Disease Control says the risk to the general public from the disease is low. It recommends using protective equipment, such as goggles, masks, and gloves, by people in contact with infected or possibly infected animals.

 The Colorado Department of Public Health and Environment said six workers, one more than reported earlier, contracted bird flu while killing and disposing of H5N1-infected hens on a poultry farm in Weld County, northeast of Boulder. “The workers … had mild symptoms, including conjunctivitis [pink eye] and common respiratory infection symptoms. None were hospitalized,” the agency said.

 In addition, a Colorado dairy farmworker contracted bird flu in early July; and in 2022 a correctional inmate participating in a pre-release program was infected with the virus. Since April, three other dairy farmworkers, in Michigan and Texas, have been diagnosed with bird flu.

 Some 100.4 million birds in domestic flocks, mostly egg-laying hens and turkeys being raised for meat, have died of highly pathogenic avian influenza (HPAI) since the disease appeared in the United States in February 2022, says a

Minnesota Reformer," 


 In the 1800s, the Fond du Lac Band of Lake Superior Chippewa joined other tribes in signing a pair of treaties with the federal government, giving up massive swaths of land in return for the creation of a reservation in eastern Minnesota. The treaties included a guarantee: Tribal members would be able to return in perpetuity to the lands they were signing away to gather wild rice, known as manoomin.

 “There’s a recognition that [manoomin] is a relative that figures very prominently in the Ojibwe migration story,” said Nancy Schuldt, water projects coordinator with the environmental program for the Fond du Lac Band of Lake Superior Chippewa. “It is one of the hallmarks of the how and the why [that] the Ojibwe people found themselves migrating to the western Great Lakes.”

 Retaining the right to harvest manoomin allowed tribal members to maintain a connection to their ancestral lands, even as they were forced to live within reservation boundaries. But wild rice is very sensitive to environmental conditions, and the tribe found that sulfate pollution from nearby mining threatened the waters on which their harvest depended.

 The tribe fought for decades to get the state of Minnesota to issue water quality standards to protect wild rice and, later, to enforce those standards. But Wisconsin, where the Fond du Lac Band also retains harvesting rights in certain areas, has been much slower to enact similar protections.

 Tribal leaders are hopeful that a new federal rule will change that.

 This May, the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency issued a revision to the Clean Water Act that requires states to consider tribal treaty rights when crafting water quality regulations. The rule could protect resources such as wild rice, sturgeon, salmon and shellfish.

 While many tribes have issued pollution standards for waters within their own boundaries, the federal rule will cover off-reservation landscapes on which Native people still exercise hard-won rights to hunt, fish and gather. Such areas cover millions of acres mapped out in dozens of treaties, concentrated especially in the Great Lakes and Pacific Northwest.

 State regulators have long been tasked with setting water quality standards for those areas. Now, the new rule directs them to consider the treaty-protected aquatic species that depend on those waters. For instance, states may be forced to lower pollution thresholds in some waters to account for the fact that tribal members who practice subsistence lifestyles consume fish at higher rates than the general public.

 Daniel Cordalis, an attorney with the Native American Rights Fund, a tribal advocacy group, said tribes have long been frustrated with some state regulators for setting regulations without tribal input.

 “Tribes have been asking for this for a long time,” he said. “These are federally based rights that need to be incorporated into the calculus as you’re developing or revising a water quality standard.”

 In Washington state, a landmark court decision in 1974 forced the state to recognize tribal fishing rights, and entitled tribal members to half of the harvestable catch. Officials with the Washington State Department of Ecology say they have a formal process for reaching out to tribal governments whenever they propose a new rule.

 In 2009, agency leaders began a dialogue with tribes over the state’s human health criteria. The agency had long relied on baseline federal figures — meaning pollution limits were set on an assumption that residents eat 6.5 grams of fish per day.

 After discussions with tribal groups, however, officials determined that the baseline figure was too low to protect tribal members whose diets are heavy in salmon and other culturally important aquatic species. Higher consumption rates made tribal members vulnerable to accumulations of mercury and other contaminants that fish can pick up in polluted water.

 “We knew it needed to be updated and be reflective of fish consumption that was really happening in Washington state by tribes,” said Melissa Gildersleeve, who oversees water quality standards for the agency. “We’ve gotten used to that conversation around tribal data.”

 In 2016, Washington state issued new criteria based on a consumption rate of 175 grams per day, nearly 30 times the previous assumption. Because of tribes’ right to harvest fish, waters throughout the state gained extra protections in order to ensure that right could be exercised safely.

 But other states have been more resistant, with a dozen joining a lawsuit seeking to get the new EPA rule thrown out. They argue that it treads on states’ delegated authority to set standards under the conditions laid out in the Clean Water Act, putting tribal interests before states’ judgment. The lawsuit also asserts that treaty rights are guarantees made by the federal government, and putting the onus on states to validate and uphold those rights gives them a near-impossible task.

 “This starkly conflicts with the [Clean Water Act’s] specific recognition, preservation, and protection of the States’ primary right and responsibility to establish designated uses and consequent water quality standards,” the plaintiffs wrote.

 The states challenging the rule are Alaska, Idaho, Iowa, Louisiana, Montana, Nebraska, North Dakota, South Carolina, South Dakota, Texas, Utah and Wyoming.

 Tribal leaders say that Idaho and other states in the case have long ignored tribes’ attempts to have their rights considered. They say the rule is necessary because states have demonstrated that they won’t listen to tribes unless they’re forced to.

 “Historically, it’s taken litigation to get states to recognize tribes’ rights, and that’s really expensive,” said Gussie Lord, managing attorney of the Tribal Partnerships Program with Earthjustice, an environmental law group. “This provides a framework for a process that has been divisive and adversarial.”

 Some other tribal advocates believe the rule, if upheld, could represent a massive shift. They note that pollution isn’t the only factor preventing the exercise of their rights. In some areas, irrigation for agriculture or the construction of dams have reduced water flows in rivers and choked off fish populations.

 “This could be one tool in restoring the flows back into these waterways,” said Ken Norton, chair of the National Tribal Water Council, a tribal advocacy group.

 The states opposing the rule fear the same outcome, arguing that it would conflict with states’ authority to delegate water rights.

 The rule could also require states to set higher standards even in waters where treaty rights aren’t currently being exercised. If tribes aren’t harvesting fish in a river because it’s polluted, states must consider what the harvest might look like if poor water quality didn’t prevent tribes from exercising their right.

 The EPA did not grant an interview request to discuss the rule and its implications.

 Seventy-six percent of winter wheat were in the bin as of Sunday, up from 71% a week earlier and ahead of the prior five-year average 72%, the USDA said in a report. 

 Seventy-seven percent of U.S. spring wheat were in Good or Excellent condition at the start of the week, unchanged from seven days earlier but well ahead of the 49% that earned top ratings at the same point a year earlier, the agency said. 

 Eighty-nine percent of the crop were headed, up from 76% a week earlier but one percentage point behind the average for this time of year. 

 Underpinning prices, however, was a report from FranceAgriMer showing only 52% of the French crop in Good or Excellent shape as of about a week ago. That was down from 57% the previous week and 80% at this point last year. 

 Farmers in France have harvested 14% of their soft wheat, well behind the 51% in the bin at this time last year, FranceAgriMer said. 

 Soybean futures were modestly higher in overnight trading.

 Sixty-eight percent of U.S. beans were Good or Excellent as of Sunday, unchanged week to week but ahead of the 54% that earned top ratings a year earlier. 

 Twenty-nine percent of the crop were setting pods, up from 18% seven days earlier. Sixty-five percent were blooming versus 51% the previous week, the USDA said. 

 Corn ratings declined one percentage point, with 67% in Good or Excellent condition, the government said. Seventeen percent were in dough stage, up from 8% last week, and 61% were in silk stage, well above 41% seven days earlier. 

 Wheat futures for September delivery fell 5½¢ to $5.42½ a bushel overnight on the Chicago Board of Trade (CBOT). Kansas City futures lost 7¾¢ to $5.64 a bushel.

 Corn futures for December delivery fell ¾¢ to $4.14¼ a bushel.

 Inspections of corn and wheat for overseas delivery declined week to week, while soybean assessments increased, according to USDA data. 

 Corn inspections in the seven days ending July 18 dropped to 970,539 metric tons, the USDA said in a report late Monday. 

 Still, that's almost triple the amount inspected during the same week a year earlier. 

 Examinations of wheat for export declined to 237,965 tons, down from 620,707 tons a week earlier and 361,135 tons at the same point in 2023, the government said. 

 Soybean inspections, meanwhile, rose to 327,061 tons from 175,327 tons the week prior. The total was also higher than the 288,655 tons examined during the same week last year. 

 Since the start of the marketing year, on Sept. 1, the USDA has inspected 45.6 million metric tons of corn for overseas delivery. That’s up from the 34.3 million tons assessed during the same time frame a year earlier. 

 Soybean assessments since the beginning of September now stand at 42.4 million tons, down from the 50.2 million tons inspected in the same period last year. 

 Wheat inspections since the start of the grain’s marketing year on June 1 are at 2.59 million metric tons, up from the 2.16 million assessed at this point a year ago, the USDA said in its report.

Mariah Squire," Corn conditions in North Carolina are still the worst of any top-producing state by far. The state had the greatest percentages of Very Poor and Poor corn, as well as the lowest percentages of Good and Excellent corn the week ending July 21.

 However, its combined percentage of Very Poor/Poor corn decreased for the first time since early June, indicating an overall improvement of corn condition.


 According to the most recent Crop Progress report, for the week ending July 21, the USDA rated North Carolina’s corn as follows: 31% Very Poor, 35% Poor, 19% Fair, 14% Good, and 1% Excellent. That compares with ratings from the week prior: 44% Very Poor, 29% Poor, 18% Fair, 9% Good, and 0% Excellent.


 Recent more favorable weather has played a role in the improvement, according to Kathie Dello, North Carolina’s state climatologist and the director of the North Carolina State Climate Office. “We’ve been lucky to return to a cooler, more showery weather pattern for the second half of July — bringing some much needed relief to our producers,” Dello says.


 Other North Carolina crops also showed some improvement.


 
For the week ending July 21, the USDA rated North Carolina soybeans as follows: 5% Very Poor, 16% Poor, 34% Fair, 40% Good, and 5% Excellent. That’s much improved compared with the week ending July 14. At that point, soybeans were rated 7% Very Poor, 24% Poor, 43% Fair, 26% Good, and 0% Excellent. 


 
For the week ending July 21, the USDA rated North Carolina peanuts as follows: 3% Very Poor, 4% Poor, 32% Fair, 54% Good, and 7% Excellent. The week prior, ending July 14, a combined total of 12% of the peanut crop were rated Very Poor/Poor. Only 46% were rated Good, and and 4% were rated Excellent. 


 
 For the week ending July 21, the USDA rated pasture and range for the state as follows: 6% Very Poor, 18% Poor, 59% Fair, 16% Good, and 1% Excellent. Those conditions are far better than the week ending July 14. At that point they were rated 12% Very Poor, 43% Poor, 32% Fair, 13% Good, and 0% Excellent.


 Thomas Shaw raises flue-cured tobacco, corn, soybeans, and wheat in north-central Vance County, by the Virginia border. Shaw explained why he described his corn as “severely damaged.”

 “In June, we had extreme drought and temperatures here and that really damaged our corn.” Shaw said. He added that although a rainy July helped some of the corn recover, the overall condition remains “very poor,” and he says he doesn’t have high hopes for much of a yield. 


 The weather also has adversely affected Shaw’s soybeans, especially his double crop behind wheat. Hot, dry weather was an issue even before June: In April it delayed planting. “The first planted beans are starting to bloom, but they don’t have much size [at] all to them,” Shaw says. He added that the soybean canopies are not forming, as they should be. Like corn, he does not expect much yield.


 While June was hot and dry, July has seen excessive rain. “We went from one extreme to the other,” he said. It’s now affecting the ability to spray for weeds.


 Shaw says he’s hopeful some of his soybeans can recover. However, he knows sufficient rain and suitable temperatures were lacking during a critical window for corn. “Corn, you know,” he says, “that doesn’t come back.”


 David Hight raises tobacco, peppers, corn, soybeans, and wheat in Warren County, northeast of Raleigh by the Virginia state line. He described his corn to be “in terrible shape.” The poor weather’s timing exacerbated the effect.

 “The hottest and driest point of the year was during pollination, and a lot of our corn didn’t pollinate,” he says. He explains that his crops got very little rain from May 20 until July 4. In one location he measured during that period, the total precipitation was 0.60 inches. With that and temperatures of 90°F to 100°F almost every day, the weather absolutely took a toll, he says, especially on corn.


 Like Shaw, Hight says dry weather through April negatively affected planting, and additional dryness since then even forced some replanting. “These beans [have] a long way to go,” he says. 


 Also like Shaw, Hight says his crops have received some much needed rain in July — but almost too much. “We’ve been getting good rain, actually to the point we really need it to slow down a little bit,” he says. But, “We really can’t get work done because of it.”


 Hight says this year’s conditions remind him of 2010, except that year provided no respite by rain, as this July has. He went on to say that last month ranks as one of the driest Junes he’s seen in his lifetime.


 Melissa Simmons is a crop insurance specialist for the North Carolina Farm Bureau and works with producers in the northern part of the state. She’s been selling crop insurance since 2015 and says producers are being very proactive when it comes to insurance claims.

 “We definitely are filing claims much sooner than we normally would because of the drought,” she says, spurred by the corn’s small cob size along with the crop’s declining price. Early planted corn has been affected the most, she says. The affected corn was at the tasseling stage when the drought occurred.


 Simmons says a coworker who covers the southern part of North Carolina has filed claims on behalf of nearly all his corn producers. “It's good to go ahead and file those claims early because we don’t know what the future holds,"" she says. “We don’t know how much it will recover.”

 All parts of Iowa — for the first time in more than four years — have sufficient soil moisture to not be considered “abnormally dry” by national climate experts, according to a U.S. Drought Monitor report on Thursday.

 That dryness designation can indicate an area is on the cusp of drought conditions, under which affected areas can have negative impacts for agriculture and water supplies.

 An example: After years of drought, a lake that supplies water for the city of Osceola had lost so much of its volume that the city considered 
. Significant rainfall in recent months has restored the lake to nearly its normal surface elevation, according to city data.

 Drought developed in Iowa in July 2020 and persisted 
, after the state had one of its wettest starts to a year on record. It marked a dramatic recovery since September, when the state was the driest it had been in a decade.

 Last week, Iowa had rainfall that was below average, according to State Climatologist Justin Glisan. However, heavy rain fell along the eastern edge of the state, where the last remaining pocket of abnormal dryness lay.

 A month ago, about 31% of the state was abnormally dry, according to Drought Monitor reports. The last time there was no drought or dryness was May 2020.

 The federal Climate Prediction Center does not foresee drought re-emerging in Iowa in the coming months. Iowa lies in the center of a multistate area that has no drought and little abnormal dryness.

 Summit Carbon Solutions argues that the main components of two county ordinances in Iowa that sought to limit the placement of carbon dioxide pipelines are entirely overridden by the authority of state and federal regulators.

 The company reasserted those arguments in a recent brief in federal court — its response to 
 by Shelby and Story counties of 
 late last year that agreed with Summit. An injunction prevents the counties from enforcing the ordinances.

 The filings of written arguments by both sides of the case set the stage for oral arguments before a panel of Eighth Circuit U.S. Court of Appeals judges. The oral arguments are not yet scheduled. The judges are expected to issue a decision sometime next year.

 Summit seeks to build a 2,500-mile pipeline system in five states to transport captured carbon dioxide from ethanol producers to North Dakota, where the greenhouse gas would be pumped into the ground. It received preliminary approval in Iowa 
.

 The work is incentivized by generous federal tax credits with the goal of slowing climate change. But many opponents of the project worry about the safety of people and animals near the pipeline that might be suffocated if it ruptures.

 The county ordinances create minimum separation distances — or setbacks — between the pipelines and populated places, such as cities, homes and livestock buildings.

 The federal judge who ruled against the first county ordinances said, in part, they were so restrictive that they might make it impossible for a carbon dioxide pipeline to be built at all.

 A handful of ordinances that were adopted by other counties — most of which are also the target of pending lawsuits by Summit — were increasingly less restrictive. The most recent one was approved in April 
, which has not been sued. Summit has declined to comment on the matter.

 Chief Judge Stephanie Rose, of the federal Southern District of Iowa, said the Shelby and Story ordinances’ placement requirements are overruled by state regulators — the Iowa Utilities Commission — and that their safety-related provisions are the jurisdiction of federal regulators — the Pipeline and Hazardous Materials Safety Administration.

 Rose went further and decided that the counties’ placement requirements are also a safety feature and are overridden by PHMSA, but the agency itself has contradicted the judge.

 “Local governments have traditionally exercised broad powers to regulate land use, including setback distances and property development that includes development in the vicinity of pipelines,” wrote Alan Mayberry, a pipeline safety administrator for PHMSA, to Summit in September. “Nothing in the federal pipeline safety law impinges on these traditional prerogatives of local — or state — government, so long as officials do not attempt to regulate the field of pipeline safety preempted by federal law.”

 However, Summit argues Rose was correct about the relationship of setbacks and safety, and its attorneys point to an early version of Story’s ordinance: “Story County started down this path solely out of concern for pipeline safety,” attorney Ryan Koopmans wrote in the recent appeal brief. “The county’s first ordinance, No. 306, focused only on setbacks because there are ‘risks in the event of a spill or rupture.’”

 Summit further says county ordinance provisions that obviously pertain to safety — such as requirements to disclose certain information to local emergency officials to aid their potential response to a breach — is also PHMSA’s jurisdiction.

 As for determining the pipeline routes, Summit argues state law gives the Iowa Utilities Commission absolute authority: “It does not matter whether Summit or any other pipeline company could somehow thread the needle through the counties’ heavily restrictive setbacks, or whether the counties would grant variances and let the pipeline pass through anyway (and they clearly will not),” Koopmans wrote.

 The American Petroleum Institute, which lobbies for the nation’s oil and natural gas industries, and the Liquid Energy Pipeline Association also recently filed a brief in support of Summit’s positions.

 They said pipelines are vital to the U.S. economy, are the safest way to transport energy products, and that the ordinances would have “far-reaching ramifications and unintended consequences.”

 “PHMSA, and PHMSA alone, has the authority to regulate the safety of interstate pipelines,” wrote Christina Manfredi McKinley, an attorney who represents the groups. “The counties’ broad-based ordinances threaten to topple this balance, and with it, not just PHMSA’s nationwide system of pipeline safety standards, but also, millions of miles of pipeline systems that transport the nation’s energy commodities and support the nation’s economy. This observation is not hyperbolic. Far from it. … The court should not countenance the counties’ vaguely cloaked attempts to legislate beyond the scope of their authority, however disguised.”

 The ultimate effect of the court action on the pending lawsuits against other counties is not yet clear. They have been paused until the Shelby and Story appeals conclude.

 PHMSA is in the process of revamping its safety standards for carbon dioxide pipelines, and the counties have said the current rules are not adequate to protect the public. They argue that there is room for some measure of local control of the issue.

 Northern California’s Park Fire has surpassed 360,000 acres and triggered evacuation orders affecting four counties, 
. The network added that by Sunday morning, containment had increased to 12%, according to Cal Fire.

 The state issued evacuation orders for four northern counties — Butte, Plumas, Shasta, and Tehama — the network's Richard Ramos, Brandon Downs, and Cecilio Padilla reported Sunday. They said the state's largest wildfire this year and California's seventh-largest ever has scorched an area more than five times the size of the city of Sacramento.

 The wildfire has threatened cattle, bees, and other livestock as it advanced into Tehama County from its starting point in north Chico, 
. “It has been a rough six years for agribusiness owners in Butte and Tehama counties, who fought to save their farms from two other major wildfires and numerous smaller fires,” Skropanic reported.

 Smoke settling in the valley can make harvesting difficult and unpleasant for farmers, but ranchers and honeybee keepers are directly in the fire’s path, Rory Crowley, a commercial agribusiness loan officer in Paradise, told Skropanic. “They’re on summer range, which is up in the mountains,” he said. “Cattle and bees need water, so they summer at higher altitudes.”

 Area ranchers under evacuation orders were hesitant to leave their stock, Crowley told the newspaper.

 Eastern Oregon’s Durkee Fire is affecting farmers and ranchers in that region, 
. “Ranchers in Vale told KGW there’s no way to know at this time just how many cattle — and ranches — have been lost to the flames,” she said.

 Rancher Mark McBride told McCarty the blaze was “completely devastating,” noting one of his family's ranches was “right in the middle of it, and one of them is next to come if we can’t get it stopped.” McBride, also a volunteer firefighter for Vale Rangeland Fire Protection Association, added: “High emotions, high losses. And it will remain that way for a generation.”

 The fire forced a rancher in far eastern Oregon's Rye Valley to leave behind 150 pair of mothers and calves, a wildfire fighter told an Idaho TV reporter. Blake Maxwell, based in Montana, 
 that if the cattle survive, they are most likely sick or injured.

 “I watched fire corral these cows in the corner of a pasture,” Maxwell told Shumpert, of KTVB. “I tried to get up there and cut the fence for them, and I couldn’t quite get there in time.” Shumpert said it was unsure if the cattle survived because the area has not been surveyed.

 “A lot of those ranchers they may have to sell off most of their cows, take them to the sale barn, because they can’t afford to feed them, because the grass they’re depending on is now ash on the ground,” Maxwell told the reporter.

Mariah Squire," According to USDA’s most recent Crop Progress report, all of the country’s top corn-producing states now have at least some percentage of corn that has reached the dough stage. Five of those states are ahead of their respective five-year averages by at least 10 percentage points and up to 21 percentage points. 


 According to USDA, 62% of Missouri’s corn crop had reached the dough stage the week ending July 28. Last year at this time, only 51% of the crop was at the dough stage. What’s more, the five-year average is 41% – that’s 21 percentage points lower than the current percentage of dough-stage corn. 


 In terms of good-to-excellent corn, 78% of Missouri’s corn falls in this category, ranking second of top-producing states (behind Pennsylvania). The state also ranked second for the most corn rated excellent (behind Nebraska). Overall, Missouri’s corn rated 4% very poor, 4% poor, 14% fair, 58% good, and 20% excellent.


 Favorable weather and soil moisture levels undoubtedly played a role in the progress and condition of Missouri’s corn. According to USDA, the average temperature statewide was 76.5°F, which was 1°F below normal, and soil moisture levels were mostly adequate. USDA rated topsoil moisture supply 1% very short, 10% short, 84% adequate, and 5% surplus and subsoil moisture supply 0% very short, 6% short, 92% percent adequate, and 2% surplus.


 USDA said that 37% of Nebraska’s corn crop had reached the dough stage the week ending July 28. That’s a jump of 19 percentage points and 17 percentage points compared to last year at this time and the five-year average, respectively.


 At 27%, Nebraska had the most corn rated excellent of the country’s top producers. The breakdown of condition ratings by USDA for the state is as follows: 3% very poor, 7% poor, 16% fair, 47% good, and 27% excellent.


 Travis Gustafson, an Agronomic Service Representative for Syngenta Crop Protection covering central and western Nebraska, described sustained high temperatures that are not taking as much of a toll on crops as they could. He explained the following for the week ending July 28: “Average highs were in the 90’s with this pattern forecasted to continue for the next seven to 10 days. While it is hot, it is not unprecedented for this time of year. The early season rains we had in Nebraska helped to build the subsoil moisture profile back up from the drought conditions we had last year and the crop does not seem to be showing signs of stress despite the high temperatures.”


 In the Buckeye State, 25% of the corn crop had reached the dough stage, USDA said Monday. That’s quite a surge compared to a five-year average of 9%, and even more striking compared to the percentage of corn at the dough stage last year at this time: only 2%.


 Ohio’s corn was rated by USDA as follows: 1% very poor, 4% poor, 29% fair, 55% good, and 11% excellent.


 Despite great progress and condition numbers, Ohio’s recent weather is causing some concern. The most recent U.S. Drought Monitor report showed that nearly 70% of the state was abnormally dry or worse as of July 23. State Statistician Ben Torrance said that the dry conditions were beginning to worry farmers; that’s according to the USDA NASS Ohio Crop Weather report released July 29. 


 As of July 28, 48% of the corn crop in Kansas had reached the dough stage. That’s 16 percentage points ahead of the five-year average. It’s also an increase of 18 percentage points since the week prior and 13 percentage points compared to last year at this time.


 As for corn conditions, only about half of Kansas’ corn was in good or excellent shape as of July 28. USDA rated 5% of the state’s corn very poor, 12% poor, 31% fair, 40% good, and 12% excellent.


 According to USDA, 34% of Iowa’s corn crop had reached the dough stage as of July 28. Although that’s only 2 percentage points up from where the state’s crop was last year at this time, it’s 10 percentage points ahead of the five-year average. 


 Iowa’s corn is largely in good shape, with only 4% rating very poor or poor. The specific condition breakdown for the state is as follows: 1% very poor, 3% poor, 19% fair, 58% good, and 19% excellent.

 Soaring temperatures made it difficult for farm workers to protect themselves from chickens recently infected by avian influenza in Colorado and likely contributed to five people contracting the virus, according to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.

 State health officials 
 last week — the largest cluster of human infections in the country since the bird flu outbreak began more than two years ago.

 Human infections are 
 to public health officials because they increase the likelihood that the virus could mutate to easily pass from person to person and spur a human pandemic. A total of 10 infections among people have been discovered since April 2022.

 But the virus found in the Colorado workers does not possess such a mutation, said Dr. Nirav Shah, principal deputy director for the CDC, in a Tuesday call with reporters. It’s believed they were each infected by egg-laying chickens as they sought to cull a flock of about 1.8 million in the northeast part of the state.

 It is customary to kill entire flocks when they are infected by highly pathogenic avian influenza — which readily infects and kills poultry — to prevent its spread to other flocks.

 The Colorado workers grabbed the chickens, placed them into containers that can hold dozens at a time, and asphyxiated them with carbon dioxide, said Dr. Julie Gauthier, executive director for field operations for the U.S. Department of Agriculture’s Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service.

 The workers typically wear suits, goggles, gloves, and boots, and they breathe through respirators that protect them from pathogens.

 But the outdoor temperature at the time of the work was about 100°, and the temperature inside the facility was likely hotter. Giant fans moved air to cool the inside, which circulated potentially virus-laden debris such as feathers.

 “The difficulty with wearing all that gear in that kind of heat, you can imagine,” Gauthier said, “and it was made more difficult by those fans pushing the air — made it hard to keep those goggles and N95 respirators in place.”

 The virus that infected the flock is similar to one that has infected dairy cattle in 13 states, Shah said. Colorado has had the most infected herds of any state, with at least 37. It’s possible that the virus was transported to the egg-laying flock from one of those herds, Shah said.

 Highly pathogenic avian influenza has been spread by wild birds and has been sporadically devastating for U.S. poultry flocks since January 2022. About 99 million birds in infected flocks have been destroyed, according to CDC data.

 Federal officials believe the virus passed from wild birds 
 in December. Since then it has spread to herds in other states, likely due to the transportation of infected cattle. From there it is believed to have spread locally to other herds and poultry flocks via people and their equipment, including farm workers and veterinarians.

 Colorado accounts for seven of the 10 known human infections in the United States that were the result of interactions with sick birds and cows. It had the first-ever infection of a poultry worker, in April 2022. Early this month, a Colorado dairy worker was also infected.

 The workers who were recently infected had mild symptoms of pink eye and respiratory illness.

 GARDEN CITY, Kan. — Western Kansas is hopping this summer, as the number of grasshoppers spikes.

 Kansas State University Research and Extension Entomologist Anthony Zukoff said wet weather patterns this spring are supporting the presence of large grasshopper populations across western and central portions of the state.

 Zukoff said hot, dry summers increase the likelihood of young grasshoppers, or nymphs, surviving to adulthood. More adult grasshoppers mean increased egg production during cooler months. If the following spring is warm and wet, more eggs hatch, and more nymphs can survive.

 “So, several years of hot, dry summers followed by warm, wet springs can eventually lead to large populations of grasshoppers in some regions,” Zukoff said.

 Ag producers in western Kansas will have lessened chances for rainfall over the next several days. The extended outlook from meteorologists at the National Weather Service office in Dodge City calls for thunderstorm chances to taper off, and temperatures to remain around 90°F through the end of the month.

 K-State Assistant State Climatologist Matt Sittel said the hottest point of the summer has passed, with five days in July registering above 100°F across much of the state.

 Sittel said July 15 was the hottest day so far this year in Kansas, with an average high temperature across the Kansas Mesonet weather observation system of 102°F. At least 30 Mesonet sites reached 100°F each day July 12–15. The hottest temperature reading of the year for Kansas came on July 13, when Webster Dam in Rooks County recorded a high of 111°F.

 Sittel said the probabilities stretching into August favor above-normal temperatures and near-normal chances of precipitation for most of the state.

 Zukoff said the extra rainfall in early spring has helped spur leafy plant growth, including broadleaf weeds, which grasshoppers thrive in. Ag producers should be aware of higher-than-normal grasshopper numbers, but most crops should be mature enough to withstand some defoliation from grasshoppers eating them, according to Zukoff.

 He said five to eight grasshoppers per square yard in corn or sorghum fields may be enough to warrant insecticide treatment.

 “Later this season, fall-planted crops could be at risk, especially as alternate food sources are controlled or go dormant,” Zukoff said.

 If an ag producer planting alfalfa finds 15 or more grasshoppers per square yard around the planting area, Zukoff recommends treating the area before planting.

 For wheat, the vegetated borders around the planting areas should be scouted at least 10 days before planting, Zukoff said, with treatment recommended if there are seven to 12 grasshoppers per square yard.

 Zukoff said three or more grasshoppers per square yard within a wheat field can destroy seedling wheat stands. Seed treatments can protect emerging wheat plants for several weeks, as long as the grasshopper population remains low.

Chuck Abbott," Except for the “lame duck long shot” of a post-election compromise, the slim chances that Congress will pass a new farm bill this year “have become nonexistent,” farm policy expert 
 said Thursday. The primary reason is the “long-unspecified demand” by Republicans for higher crop subsidy spending without providing details, wrote Coppess, a USDA official during the Obama era, at the farmdoc daily blog.

 Progress on the farm bill was also mired in disagreements over SNAP cuts and climate funding. Congress is nearly 10 months late in replacing the 2018 farm law.

 Earlier this week during a 
, House Agriculture Committee chair Glenn Thompson (R-Pa.) said it would be September before the farm bill is debated in the House. The senior Republican on the Senate Agriculture Committee, John Boozman of Arkansas, said, “If we can’t make a meaningful change” in the so-called reference prices that trigger subsidy payments, “I think we’re better off with an extension” of current law into 2025.

 The already slim chances of farm bill reauthorization in 2024 “are wilting in the summer heat, facing a legislative calendar almost out of days,” Coppess said. He added that the farm bill approved by the House Agriculture Committee on May 24 “lacks a viable path with the budget and political problems facing it.”

 The bill would increase crop subsidy and crop insurance outlays by one-third from current levels but offsets only part of the cost, according to the Congressional Budget Office. The bill also would cut SNAP spending. House Republicans unsuccessfully sought SNAP cuts in the 2014 and 2018 farm laws.

 “All that remains is an outside chance” of agreement on a farm bill after the Nov. 5 general election —the “lame duck long shot,” Coppess said. “It is more likely that any lame duck session will merely extend the 2018 farm bill again.”

 The farm bill is on the back burner in Congress, where annual government funding bills are at the top of the agenda. There has been little urgency in farm bill discussions.

 Higher reference prices and an expansion of crop insurance are long-standing farm bill priorities for farm groups. Lawmakers from farm states have often said they want “more farm in the farm bill.” Months passed, however, without a public statement of how large an increase was wanted in reference prices or how to pay for it.

 Boozman proposed a 15% increase in reference prices for row crops, such as corn, soybeans, and wheat, as part of a 
 released in June. The Republican-written farm bill in the House also calls for a 15% increase. Republican staff workers on the Senate Agriculture Committee said the cost of higher reference prices could be offset through savings in the farm bill baseline of $1.4 billion over 10 years.

 In an outline released in May, Senate Agriculture Committee chair 
 (D-Mich.) said the major row crops should be assured of a 5% increase in reference prices, and she said she had the $5 billion to cover the cost. In late June, she said an extension of the 2018 farm bill might be necessary because of inaction on the new farm bill.

 “Republicans are breaking the farm and food coalition by falsely claiming that increased program cost for food security through SNAP has somehow taken resources away from farms or left farms out of the mix,” Stabenow said. “Such a framing is disingenuous and misleading.”

 In his acceptance speech at the Republican National Convention late last week, former President Donald Trump made no direct mention of agriculture. But he touched on a number of issues — electric vehicles, clean energy, and trade — that directly affect the agriculture industry.

 “Trump started the rambling 1½-hour speech on a unifying note and by recounting, for the first time in public, how he escaped assassination on Saturday in Butler, Pennsylvania,” 
 late last week. “… But Trump eventually pivoted into long riffs on his priority issues, including trade, energy, and immigration.”

 Trump made perhaps his strongest remarks when it came to electric vehicles, with 
 that “former President Donald Trump used his nomination speech to take aim at President Joe Biden’s electric vehicle policies, vowing to action against them on his first day in office.”

 “ ‘I will end the electric vehicle mandate on day one,’ Trump said in his address at the Republican National Convention in Milwaukee. The move would result in ‘saving the U.S. auto industry from complete obliteration, which is happening right now, and saving U.S. customers thousands and thousands of dollars per car,’ he said,” Natter reported. “While the Biden administration doesn’t have a mandate on electric vehicles, critics of new air pollution limits issued by the Environmental Protection Agency in March have said they would illegally force automakers to sell EVs.”

 
 late last week that “corn growers and ethanol producers fear the emission standards will depress demand for ethanol-blended gasoline, although it’s not clear how much and how fast the reduction in demand would be. At the same time, the biofuel industry is looking to preserve tax incentives created by the IRA to subsidize production of sustainable aviation fuel.”

 Natter reported that “Trump’s remarks on EVs came just moments before he criticized what he said was trillions of dollars of wasteful spending ‘having to do with the green new scam.’ He said he would instead direct the money to projects like roads, bridges and dams, though it wasn’t immediately clear how he would make good on the pledge.”

 Brasher reported that the “green new scam” “was an apparent reference to the Inflation Reduction Act enacted in 2022. The IRA, which included funding for farm bill conservation programs, was estimated to cost well under $1 trillion. But Trump promised to somehow redirect clean energy funding to infrastructure projects. ‘We will not allow it to be spent on Green New Scam ideas,’ Trump said,” according to Brasher’s reporting.

 
 that “Trump didn’t directly talk about his pledge to impose across-the-board tariffs on imported products and duties of up to 60% on China. But he promised to bring more auto manufacturing to the United States, threatening to impose tariffs of 100% to 200% on foreign-made autos. ‘They will be unsellable in the United States,’ he said.”

 “He also touted his administration’s trade record,” Brasher reported. “ ‘We have long been taken advantage of by other countries, and think of it, oftentimes these other countries are considered so-called allies,’ Trump said. ‘We lose jobs, we lose revenue, and they gain everything, and wipe out our businesses, wipe out our people. I stopped it for four years, I stopped it.’ ”

 “He also mentioned the U.S.-Mexico-Canada trade agreement that replaced the North American Free Trade Agreement, which Trump called the ‘worst trade deal ever made,’ ” Brasher reported.

 Trump’s comments on trade followed a speech from his pick for vice president, Sen. J.D. Vance of Ohio, who “blames increased trade with China, Mexico and other low-wage countries for job losses that have devastated manufacturing communities in the industrial Rust Belt, including his home state of Ohio,”

 Federal health officials are encouraging farm workers who tend livestock and poultry to get vaccinated for seasonal influenza to help prevent a bird flu mutation that might spark a pandemic in people.

 The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention said Tuesday it would devote up to $5 million to pay for the vaccinations, and that it will rely on states to implement the initiative.

 There are 14 known human infections of highly pathogenic avian influenza that resulted from contact with infected dairy cattle and poultry in the United States, and all but one has happened in the past four months.

 The virus has been circulated by wild birds for more than two years and has sporadically transmitted to domestic birds. A variation of the virus has been infecting U.S. dairy cattle since December, and four people who worked closely with infected cattle also became ill.

 In recent weeks, nine people in Colorado who were tasked with culling infected poultry contracted the virus.

 The CDC has maintained that the virus’ risk to humans is low — those who have been infected so far had minor symptoms of respiratory illness or pinkeye, or both.

 It has not been shown to transmit between people, but the virus has the potential to rapidly gain that ability if it infects someone who also has a seasonal flu virus.

 “Such dual infections, while rare, could potentially result in an exchange of genetic material between two different influenza viruses,” Nirav Shah, principal deputy director for the CDC, said in a call with reporters Tuesday.

 Shah said that “reassortment” process could pose a “significant public health concern” if bird flu gains the ability to spread person-to-person the way seasonal flu does, potentially resulting in a virus that spreads easily and causes severe symptoms.

 Shah said the CDC will devote up to $10 million for farm workers’ health related to avian flu. Half will be spent educating and training farm workers about how to avoid being infected.

 The other half will pay for seasonal flu vaccines for an estimated 200,000 farm workers who tend livestock and poultry. The CDC hopes to vaccinate all of them but acknowledges that less than half of the general population typically gets a flu shot.

 How the voluntary vaccination effort will proceed is unclear. State health officials are expected to implement them, most immediately in the 13 states that have confirmed infections among cows.

 That includes Iowa, where 13 dairy herds have been infected. However, no new infections have been reported in the state in the past month.

 A spokesperson for the Iowa Department of Health and Human Services — which presumably would coordinate with the CDC — did not immediately respond to a request to comment for this article.

 The vaccine will not protect the workers from contracting bird flu, Shah said, nor will it guarantee they won’t be infected by seasonal flu. But he said it’s an important component of the public health response to the new virus’ threat.

 “The risk here is a theoretical but important risk,” Shah said.

 The confirmations of new bird flu infections among cattle have waned significantly in most states, except for in Colorado. In the past 30 days, two-thirds of the nation’s 32 newly infected herds were in that state, according to U.S. Department of Agriculture data.

 Some of that might be due to Colorado’s 
, but it’s also “a quirk of history and geography,” said Eric Deeble, deputy under secretary for marketing and regulatory programs for the USDA.

 The state has far fewer dairy farms than the leading milk-producing states, but most of them are concentrated in one county.

 “They are all in very close proximity to one another, and so there is a lot of sharing of equipment, a lot of sharing of personnel and a lot of movement on and off farms to adjacent farms,” Deeble said.

 The USDA has identified the movement of equipment and people between dairy farms as a primary vector for virus transmissions from herd to herd and from herd to flock.

 The virus has been identified in 172 dairy herds in the United States this year. Fifty of them are in Colorado. In Texas, where the infections originated, the virus was confirmed in 22 herds, although there were many that went untested because they recovered before bird flu 
 as the culprit.

Natalina Sents Bausch," As drought continues to intensify in North Carolina, the corn crop is shriveling up. More than 90% of the state’s crop is in fair condition, or worse, according to USDA’s Crop Progress report published July 15.


 Jeremy Petree has been in the crop insurance business for 15 years. “There will be a lot of claims paid this year,” he says. A farmer of 40-plus years and client recently remarked, “It’s never been this bad.”


 Petree added, “I know there was some hope that the genetics of the corn crop would help it recover and surprise everyone, but I think it’s getting late enough that the corn crop is just not going to be there.”


 According to the most recent Crop Progress report, 44% of North Carolina corn is in very poor condition, 29% is poor, 18% is fair, 9% is good. There is no excellent corn in the state.


 Some farmers are attempting to salvage their corn crop by chopping it for silage, but that won’t be an option for everyone, says Petree. “There’s so much of it out there.”


 On Monday USDA said 85% of North Carolina’s corn is silking, 3 percentage points ahead of both the five-year average and last year at this time.


 The report noted 43% of the corn crop has reached the dough growth stage, significantly ahead of the 34% five-year average. Last year at this time 32% of North Carolina’s corn had achieved dough.


 Kevin Matthews is a fourth-generation farmer in East Bend, North Carolina. “Our early corn is very rough, and the mid plantings are fair with the later just begging for rain before it tassels.”


 He’s grateful for his irrigation, adding, “If a drip tape or sprinkler isn’t doing its job, the crop will show you quickly.”


 Other North Carolina crops are struggling in the dry conditions, too. USDA rated 7% of soybeans very poor, 24% poor, 43% fair, and 26% good. There are no excellent soybeans in North Carolina.


 Matthews says his soybean crop is holding on, but “the deer damage is horrendous. Wildlife are eating the crops faster than they can grow with such little moisture.”


 Cotton is struggling, too. USDA rated 7% of North Carolina’s cotton crop very poor, 14% poor, 39% fair, 44% good, and 5% excellent.


 North Carolina peanuts were rated 3% very poor, 9% poor, 38% fair, 46% good, and 4% excellent for the week ending July 14.


 Pasture and range conditions in the state were rated 12% very poor, 43% poor, 32% fair, and 13% good. There was no excellent pasture reported in North Carolina.


 Farmers are harvesting their second cutting of hay, but not as quickly as last year. USDA said 27% of second cutting was complete the week ending July 14. That’s well behind the five-year average of 38%.


 Drought has spread and intensified quickly over the last three months. At the beginning of April more than 88% of the state was free of drought stress.


 The most recent drought maps, published July 11, 2024, show 100% of the state is suffering from moisture stress. D3 extreme drought covers a portion of Columbus County in the southern tip of the state. More than 19% of North Carolina reported D2 severe drought conditions. Almost 68% of the state is in D1 moderate drought. Nearly 12% of North Carolina is abnormally dry.


 The Crop Progress report rated North Carolina topsoil moisture 15% very short, 34% short, 47% adequate, and 4% surplus. Subsoil moisture was rated 11% very short, 37% short, 51% adequate, and 1% surplus.


 Petree urges farmers with drought stricken crops to call their crop insurance agent promptly to get on their list. With such widespread losses in the state, “there’s a lot of corn that needs to be appraised,” he says.


 It is important to call your crop insurance agent before you start chopping or destroying anything. It needs to be appraised first. “If a crop is destroyed before someone’s had a chance to take a look at it, then there’s really not a lot anyone can do,” explains Petree.


 He adds, “Don’t be afraid to call your agent.” Crop insurance coverage is based on what production is actually harvested. “It’s not like car insurance where just turning something in and not getting any money out of it is going to increase your premium,” he says.

 As avian influenza is being detected in more and more dairy herds across the U.S., Iowa State University researchers have found a possible “why” connection to the virus being found in raw milk.

 A study published this month by a team in ISU’s College of Veterinary Medicine found that bovine mammary gland tissue held receptors for the avian influenza virus, offering a potential explanation for how cattle are being infected.

 Todd Bell, a professor of veterinary pathology and co-author of the study, said the idea to look at mammary glands as a potential entry point for the virus came after it was identified in raw milk. Two ISU alums in the spring identified an illness impacting cattle in Texas as 
, and ever since different teams at the university and in partnerships with other organizations have been working to tackle the virus and its spread from different angles.

 “They really answered the ‘what,’ what was actually going on, what was making these cattle sick, which is a new and novel finding, and then our job, really, at that point as researchers was to understand the ‘why,’” Bell said. “We’ve never seen this before. Why is this happening?”

 To understand the concept, Bell suggested thinking of viruses as like keys, and receptors are like locks to cells. In order for the avian flu virus to enter a cell and reproduce, it needs the right receptor. The research team found that receptor on cattle mammary glands.

 Another receptor they found is connected to human influenza, Bell said, which is important because it opens up the possibility of a cell being infected by both viruses, potentially causing the creation of a new virus.

 “To our knowledge, that hasn’t happened yet in this particular outbreak, but we wanted to look for those receptors to understand what might be possible and hopefully stop the transmission and stop that from happening,” Bell said.

 The team also looked at the respiratory system to try and identify evidence of the bird flu, but found little there, narrowing down the possibilities of how cattle are being infected.

 According to the 
, as of July 12 the avian influenza had been detected in dairy herds in 12 states, including 13 herds in Iowa. While the virus is being detected in raw milk, the pasteurization process ensures it is safe to be consumed.

 While Bell and his colleague’s work is still very much focused on the “why” of avian flu in dairy herds and its spread, he said the hope is that their research will help inform regulators in making decisions on testing and biosecurity measures to try and stop the spread of the virus. He said there is some literature that states the virus can live on milking machines for a few hours after an infected cow is hooked up to them, offering one potential method of spread.

 “We hope that what we find will help them make those types of decisions, specifically if we can find it in mammary tissue, then how do we stop it from getting to that mammary tissue in the first place,” Bell said.

 Next steps for Bell and his colleagues include looking at the milk and mammary glands of other domestic animals, like sheep and goats, to see if they also carry receptors for the avian flu. Bell said they will also look at their respiratory systems and gastrointestinal tracts to see if the flu could have other points of entry, like if a wild bird with the virus defecates into a water supply and farm animals drink the infected water.

 Iowa Secretary of Agriculture Mike Naig said during “
” last week that longitudinal studies are also being conducted on farms to test every single animal housed there in order to track how the virus moves and determine how it exits the herd.

 “Because it will, it will eventually exit that herd and you want to be able to track those things and have an expectation of how long does that last,” he said during the program.

 Colorado health officials identified two more cases of the highly pathogenic H5N1 avian influenza — bird flu — in humans over the weekend, bringing the case count in the state to seven people who worked with inflected birds.

 A worker at a northeast Colorado commercial egg layer in Weld County, where

 Another Colorado resident

 The cluster of cases, comprising eight people in Colorado, accounts for most of the bird flu cases in humans in the country.

 The recently infected workers were dealing directly with infected poultry and experienced mild symptoms such as pink eye and respiratory infection symptoms. Officials with the U.S. Department of Agriculture said last week that heat could have

FERN's Ag Insider," Rejecting arguments by a Missouri pork processor, U.S. District Judge William Young upheld the legality of a voter-approved Massachusetts state law that requires farmers to give breeding sows room to move around and bars the sale of pork cuts produced outside the state on farms that do not meet the Massachusetts standard. 
 filed the lawsuit a year ago, soon after the Supreme Court ruled that a similar California law was constitutional, and said it offered a new avenue to challenge the constitutionality of such laws.

 “The court now, after careful consideration, determines that the (Massachusetts) Act is not preempted by the FMIA (Federal Meat Inspection Act), and therefore grants the commonwealth’s motion for summary judgment…and denies the pork producers’ motion for summary judgment,” ruled Young in a 19-page decision. “Judgment shall enter for the commonwealth.”

 The meat inspection law governs the operations of slaughterhouses and does not extend to state laws on meat marketing, contrary to Triumph Foods’ interpretation, wrote Young. Triumph and the farmers who are its member-owners are not obliged to ship whole pork cuts to Massachusetts, said the judge, who noted that Triumph segregates its products for sale as organic, grass-fed, and other specialty categories.

 Known as Question 3, the Massachusetts law was approved in a landslide in a 2016 statewide referendum. California’s Proposition 12 was approved in a statewide referendum in 2018 and took full effect at the start of this year, after the Supreme Court decision and a phase-in period for the food industry.

 For 3 years we have been pushing the planting date on ultra early soybeans. 2022 was a great success, 2023 was a flop. So going into 2024, I had already decided if it was unsuccessful the test would be abandoned. On July 22 we harvested 49 acres of soybeans. To date this will be the biggest success of all 3 years with a yield of 87 bushels per acre. The day before, I would have sold them to anyone for 70 bushel per acre.


 Seed size was the determining factor that pushed these little, short soybeans to a respectable yield. As the combines were whacking them out, the planter was putting in a second soybean crop hopefully to be harvested by mid-November. We also have one more field with a later maturity that was planted in February also so we can figure out how much maturities matter when planted that early.


 Since harvest we have had six full days of clouds and showers, which isn’t good for anything. Our next field will be desiccated hopefully Monday. We will keep you up to date on the following second crop soybeans as time goes on.


 


 It is unreal how fast things can change. A week ago I felt like many more acres would not be harvested, and yes the mental stress was at a level I’ve rarely seen. I really didn’t think some fields could take another hot dry day then Friday night a few rains fall gave some relief. More rain within a few days caused the drought to be over and the floods came after 4 to 7 inches of rain. My goodness how the crops have turned around. Some are ugly there is no doubt about that, but we’ve got something to harvest now that the soybeans are looking good. 


 The rain was perfect for the later planted corn. With the rain going into the late third and fourth quarter we have grain to protect and build weight into. The sprayers are running and the weeds have responded just like the corn and soybeans. Fungicides and foliar fertilizer are being applied.


 I got the opportunity to step away from the farm and attend AgPhD in South Dakota. It was a blast and I am thankful for everyone I got to meet and speak with. Our next big event is the XtremeAg Field Day on my farm featuring AgroLiquid, Nachurs, Pioneer Z series trials corn varieties plots and variety fertility responses. There will also be John Deere equipment and staff to get us ready for harvest.


 


 The rains have finally relieved some of the pressure from the area. Early April corn is too far gone to help at this point. Late May corn actually has a chance to make it. Later planted corn has pollinated now and should not be as bad as early planted corn. Pollination on early planted corn is really bad due to the drought and heat. 


 Early beans are at R4 and they look like they aborted a lot of pods during the dry and hot period. It is a below average crop but at least there is a crop. About 30% of double crop soybeans were planted over due to planting in dry conditions and there was just enough moisture to swell them and then they died. Once we had a few small rains the double crop beans have now come on and they look better at the moment, but they have a lot of catching up to do.

 The drought continues. The forecast has been very encouraging, 40% to 70% chance of precipitation at least 9 or 10 days of the 12-day forecast. If you’re fortunate enough to receive a rain shower in this area, they are light. Seems like they fall in the same area, but we are fortunate that some farms received rain.

 Irrigation has been a blessing on those few acres that have not received any showers, however this is our first crop to be totally raised on irrigation and let me tell you, if a drip tape or sprinkler isn’t doing its job the crop will show you quickly. Our early corn is very rough, and the mid plantings are fair with the later just begging for rains before it tassels. Those acres are getting Veltyma, BoronMax with Fulltec, Finishline, Sweet Success, and of course, Terramar to help it begin a successful pollination.

 Soybeans continue to hold on. The deer damage is horrendous, they can eat them faster than they can grow with such little moisture. It’s interesting that this year the deer are going after the corn over the soybeans. If they have a choice, we think the soybeans are just tough with little moisture and they chew on the corn stalks while leaving the leaves of the plant laying on the ground! I’ve never seen this widespread issue before.


 


 We have now entered the fourth quarter of the 2024 crop. It has definitely been a challenging year. Wet early and dry late. We had high hopes to get some moisture from tropical storm Beryl, but we did not have success.


 Our corn is approaching black layer and the soybeans are at R6. The February-planted soybeans will get one more watering and then desiccation. Looking back, I wish I had planted 1,000 acres at that time, but you just never know.

 I do think that our soybean crop looks really good, but the corn may be a little off this year. It had such a rough start, and never really made that difference up. We are forecasted to have a really hot and dry September, which should aid in a good harvest. We are about 30 to 45 days out in corn harvest, so I will definitely know something soon.


 


 Early-planted corn on the east coast is extremely bad. The drought area affected goes from Pennsylvania to Georgia. It’s the worst I’ve ever seen in my career as a farmer. A lot of areas are a zero yield. We have a little bit of rain relieving heat and drought for a small amount of time and it could help late-May-planted corn, but we think the damage has been done at this point.

 The early-planted soybeans struggled with wet weather early, then severe drought. Soybeans are extremely short and struggled to canopy. Somehow, they are still holding on for the time being. There was a window in mid- to late May where the soybeans were planted that actually look fair. A fair amount of double crop soybeans was replanted because there was just enough moisture at planting to germinate them, then they died.


 All in all, the crops in the east are a complete disaster.

 The Colorado Department of Agriculture will now require regular testing of dairy milk as the highly pathogenic H5N1 avian influenza — bird flu — continues to spread throughout the state. 

 Commercial cow dairy farms licensed by the Colorado Department of Public Health and Environment that are not already under a bird flu-related quarantine will undergo weekly testing of bulk samples. This will include facilities with dairy cattle used to produce milk, butter, pasteurized and other cheeses, frozen desserts, ice cream, dry milk, condensed milk and cottage cheese, among other products for human consumption.

 Under the mandate, samples collected from farms will be tested at the Colorado State University Veterinary Diagnostic Laboratory, and any farm whose dairy produces a non-negative test result for H5N1 will be placed under quarantine. 

 The order mandating testing does not have a set expiration date, so state agricultural leaders or the state veterinarian must issue another order to cease testing. Any farms that fail to comply with the requirements of the order will be referred to the Colorado attorney general’s office.

 “We appreciate the ongoing cooperation and partnership with both the poultry and dairy industries,” Colorado Commissioner of Agriculture Kate Greenberg said in a statement. “Mandatory surveillance of highly pathogenic avian influenza across all of Colorado’s Grade A commercial dairies is a critical next step to tamping down the virus and protecting the food system. Ongoing cooperation is key to supporting workers’ health and safety, protecting animal health and welfare, and minimizing the spread of the virus.”

 CDPHE says it is safe to eat properly handled and cooked poultry products, as the proper handling and cooking of meat and eggs kills viruses. The risk of bird flu to the general public is low and there has not been evidence of the virus spreading from person to person.

Noah Rohlfing," Michigan’s wheat harvest is moving along at a rapid speed — and a recent change in the weather is part of the reason why. 

 Following a wet June and early July for much of Michigan’s lower peninsula — particularly in the western half of the state, according to data from the Iowa Environmental Mesonet — the last two weeks have seen drier conditions throughout the state. This has allowed harvest to take off: As of the most recent U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) Crop Progress report on July 29, Michigan is 90% finished with the winter wheat harvest. 

 This is 32 percentage points ahead of wheat harvest progress at the same point in 2023, and 20 percentage points ahead of the state’s five-year average. 

 Also running ahead of schedule is Michigan’s oat harvest. As of July 29, 31% of the oat crop in the state has been harvested. The five-year average for Michigan is only 2%, and in 2023 at this stage of the year only 5% of the crop was harvested. 

 Range and pasture conditions in the state were also positive, with 77% labeled as Good/Excellent. Less rain meant hay second cuttings were at 46% complete, per the Michigan-specific Crop Progress report from the National Agricultural Statistics Service (NASS). 

 In southwestern Michigan, field crops have made progress after a reprieve from rain allowed standing water to drain from soybean fields, according to the 
. However, Extension reporters Nicolle Ritchie and Angie Gradiz did provide some detail about the impact the standing water has had on the area’s soybean crops.

 “Many soybeans are stunted and yellow from standing in pooled water caused by the heavy rains earlier this month,” Ritchie and Gradiz wrote. “This free water provides favorable conditions for Phytophthora stem and root rot infection.”

 Currently, 59% of Michigan’s soybean crop is in Good/Excellent condition. Soybeans are setting pods at 34% as of July 29, four percentage points below the state’s five-year average. Blooming is at 77%. 

 July was still wetter than average overall in the state, with chunks of southwestern, central, and eastern Michigan seeing upwards of 5 inches of precipitation more than the July average. Most of the Upper Peninsula was below its average for July, according to the Iowa Environmental Mesonet. 

 Rainfall throughout the growing season has left Michigan with only 3% of the state experiencing abnormally dry conditions, according to the latest data from the U.S. Drought Monitor. 

 The short-term predictions from the National Weather Service‘s Climate Prediction Center put most of Michigan with a higher-than-average chance of lower temperatures from Aug. 8 to Aug. 14, in tandem with a majority of the northern Corn Belt states. In addition, expectations are that Michigan will receive above-average precipitation over the same time period. 

 This runs counter to what the CPC predicts for the state overall for August — mainly above-average temperatures and equal chances of higher or lower precipitation. 

 Above-average temperatures are also expected in Michigan for September and October as growing season transitions into harvest time, the CPC said. Michigan is far from alone in this expectation: Only northern Minnesota and eastern North Dakota are not projected to experience above-average temps over the same time period. 

 Precipitation predictions have so far declined to move Michigan one way or the other.

 Rain fell in parts of Nebraska, Iowa, and Illinois throughout the week and more precipitation is expected. 

 More showers and storms are expected today in parts of Illinois, Indiana, Kentucky, and southwestern Ohio, the National Weather Service said in a statement this morning. 

 Iowa is free of dry or drought conditions and less than 3% of Illinois is seeing abnormally dry weather, according to the U.S. Drought Monitor, which is scheduled to update its maps today. 

 Underpinning prices, however, are concerns about the severity and frequency of thunderstorms that have rolled through parts of the Midwest in recent days. 

 More severe weather, including intense downpours and flash flooding, is possible with today’s storms, the agency said. 

 “Many of these locations have seen recent heavy rainfall given repeated rounds of organized storms passing through, leading to wetter antecedent conditions more sensitive to additional rainfall,” NWS said. 

 Corn futures for December delivery fell 1¼¢ to $3.98½ a bushel overnight on the Chicago Board of Trade.

 Soybean futures for November delivery lost 2¾¢ to $10.19¾ a bushel. Soymeal gained 60¢ to $316.30 a short ton and soy oil was down 0.34¢ to 41.98¢ a pound. 

 Wheat futures for September delivery gained 2¾¢ to $5.30 a bushel, while Kansas City futures rose 1¾¢ to $5.50¾ a bushel. 

 Ethanol output surged to a record high in the week that ended on July 26, according to the Energy Information Administration.

 Production of the corn-based biofuel improved to an average of 1.109 million barrels a day, the agency said in a report. That’s up from 1.095 million barrels the previous week and the highest level on record. 

 In the Midwest, by far the biggest producing region, output increased to 1.045 million barrels per day, on average, from 1.035 million a week earlier. 

 Gulf Coast production rose to 29,000 barrels from 26,000 a week earlier, EIA said. 

 Rocky Mountain output was reported at 13,000 barrels a day from 12,000 barrels the week prior, and West Coast production improved to 10,000 barrels from 9,000 barrels, the agency said.

 East Coast was again unchanged at 12,000 barrels per day. 

 USDA said in a report last month that it expects ethanol makers to use 5.45 billion bushels of corn for ethanol production in the 2024/2025 marketing year that starts on Sept. 1. If realized that would be unchanged from the current year, but up from the 5.176 billion bushels used in the 2022/2023 marketing year. 

 Ethanol inventories in the week through July 26 increased to 23.973 million barrels, the government said. 

 That’s up from 23.723 million a week earlier and the highest level for stockpiles since the week that ended on May 17, EIA said in its report. 

 Flood warnings and watches have been issued for counties in southeastern Iowa as rain continues to fall in the area, according to the National Weather Service. 

 “Excessive runoff may result in flooding of rivers, creeks, streams and other low-lying and flood-prone locations,” the agency said. “Creeks and streams may rise out of their banks.” 

 Soils are saturated from precipitation yesterday and more storms are on the way, NWS said. 

 Heat warnings and advisories will again take effect today for much of the southern Midwest and the Delta.

 Sales of corn to overseas buyers declined in the week through July 11 while wheat and bean sales rose, according to the Ag Department. 

 Corn sales for delivery in the 2023-2024 marketing year that ends on Aug. 31 totaled 437,800 metric tons, the agency said. That's down 19% from the previous week and 10% from the prior four-week average. 

 Japan purchased 191,200 metric tons, Mexico bought 129,400 tons, Colombia was in for 102,000 tons, Saudi Arabia took 60,000 tons and Portugal purchased 55,000 tons. 

 The total would've been higher but an unnamed country canceled orders for 195,100 tons and Costa Rica nixed cargoes of 10,800 tons. 

 Sales for the 2024-2025 year that starts on Sept. 1 were reported at 485,700 tons. Exports for the week jumped 26% to 1.1 million tons.

XtremeAg," XtremeAg farmer Lee Lubbers reports higher than expected wheat yields, while heat arrives in Iowa and Alabama.

 


 It is officially summertime harvest mode! We started the winter wheat harvest at the beginning of the week. Yields have been really good. It’s a slow go, but nobody is complaining, with the yields being good. We are running our combine, plus our custom harvester is running five machines. We split up into four- and two-machine crews. They have several other crews running in the central part of the state, around Pierre and Onida.


 All of their crews have moved up into South Dakota. The next moves will be North Dakota and Montana. By the time we are finished, it will be time to clean and prep to load and head out to jobs farther north.

 The pace is nonstop. They’ve come a long way from their first harvest stops, in Texas and Oklahoma, and the harvest push will go well up into Canada. Our wheat has been the best they have cut so far this year. We are crawling along at 1.5-2 mph, but for a good reason. They joke they can count the lugs on their tires while cutting.


 We finished up some R1 passes on part of our soybean crop, trying new things to see how the results are. Last year a bone-dry August skewed the data. There was too much variation in the passes to see a definitive difference. Hopefully, this year August will be more favorable. We also just got done doing some corn acres via plane just before tassel. Temperatures have been nice so far for July: many days in the 80s, buying us time on our row crops. Nice growing days, not scorching heat. But we all know the heat is coming. We are more used to 100°F days cutting wheat than 85°F.


 We are finishing up hauling our last 40,000 bushels of 2023 corn. We are binning wheat, and also shipping from the field to two different terminals. Wheat goes in one direction, then rock for road construction heads back. We will be focused on getting the wheat crop harvested. There’s a long way to go yet, and moving 400,000 bushels of wheat to take the pressure off storing fall crops in the next 30 days. With decent weather the combines should be loaded up and headed north within two weeks, and trucks will keep on humming. Summertime never stops, and neither do we. Stay safe, everyone.


 


 The heat has arrived for a few days, and because of the rain that we've had, our crop looks really good. We haven’t even turned on the irrigation yet, but it appears to me that tomorrow we will turn it on in a couple spots for the first time. Our pastures are holding on okay. We're getting to that time of the year where the brome is going downhill, which is the reason that we are doing the research with the rotational grazing and the other species of plants.


 I have been somewhat disappointed in the growth of these other plants, but the reason for the disappointment, I believe, is the chemical carryover: the atrazine from last year’s corn crop and even the herbicide from the soybeans in 2022. I think all farmers need to be aware of the chemical safety of the following year’s crops relative to what chemicals we’re using. The dry weather that we’ve had in 2022 and 2023 has allowed those chemicals to remain in that soil profile longer. I think we’re seeing the results of that in the disappointing growth.


 We’re going to stay with this rotational grazing program. We believe next year will be better. We’re continuing to learn, and it’s been an eye-opening experience to watch.


 


 Let’s talk about the drought for a second. There are a lot of different variables with soybeans and corn in the South. It just depends on whether we got rain or not.


 We’ve been in this drought and heat for the last three weeks. We’ve received some rains, but they have not been widespread. There has been some rain here, then you might get rain there, and then you might not get rain for another five miles or so. It’s just really hit or miss.


 The planting date for corn this year is really important. A lot of our early-planted corn is going to make it, significantly more than our late-planted corn. This is something we’ve seen a lot in the South when we’re trying to beat the heat. This is our normal weather pattern — we get this heat but we usually catch a good rain around the Fourth of July. When we didn’t get that rain, it really put us in a hole for rainfall this year. So the corn is drying down at a considerable rate because it’s been so hot. Some of our corn will be decent, but some of it won’t be as good.


 The early soybeans are in the same boat as the corn. In some places we’re putting fungicide on, and moving ahead with the right program where we’ve got rains. It doesn’t take a lot of rain, just a half-inch here and a half-inch there. We’re moving ahead and putting fungicide on other soybeans.


 I don’t know if you sprayed them that they would take anything in. They’ve got the leaves turned over. They’re just in bad drought stress, and they’re actually changing colors and turning yellow — you can see through them. So we’re not going to spend any more money on those until the weather changes and we see the soybeans try to turn around.


 But the soybeans that have received rain have good potential. The irrigated soybeans have good potential, and we’ve been keeping the water going — that’s a whole other struggle. We’ve been running about a dozen pivots, and I’m telling you, everyone on the farm has had their work cut out for them to keep these things going. Anyone who has worked with pivots before knows exactly what I am talking about. We are going to keep trying our best and hopefully get some good yields out of what we have.

FERN's Ag Insider," Lucrative tax credits of up to $1.25 a gallon should be available only for low-carbon fuels made from U.S.-grown feedstocks, 
 told the Biden administration on Wednesday. In a letter, the groups also said the government should broaden its list of climate-smart farming practices that produce lower-carbon “sustainable” crops.

 The letter was aimed at 45Z tax credits, which are to become available in 2025, for sustainable aviation fuel (SAF). The administration has yet to issue regulations for the credits. In April, it published a 
 for SAF produced from 2022-24. Under the guidance, only a fraction of U.S. biofuels would qualify for the 40B credits. The Biden administration has a goal of increasing SAF production to 3 billion gallons by 2030.

 “However, without clear domestic feedstock requirements, the benefits of this policy are at risk of being diverted from American farmers,” said the letter. “The 45Z tax credit has the potential to be a game-changer for our industry.”

 The 40B guidelines lack a domestic feedstock requirement, said the letter, and they are too rigid in saying that jet fuel produced from ethanol must come from corn grown on farms that used no-till, planted cover crops following harvest, and applied enhanced-efficiency fertilizer or be made from biomass-based diesel derived from soybeans grown on farms that used no-till and cover crops. “Additional options from compliance must be considered,” the groups said.

 The letter was signed by the American Farm Bureau Federation, the National Farmers Union, the National Corn Growers Association, and the American Soybean Association.

 Separately, fertilizer maker CF Industries and ethanol maker POET announced a 
 in the western Corn Belt that would use low-carbon ammonia fertilizer to grow corn for ethanol production. The practice “can reduce the carbon intensity of ethanol up to 10 percent,” said the companies. The test would begin this fall and continue through the 2025 harvest.

Chuck Abbott," Nine farmworkers at two egg farms in Colorado have contracted mild cases of bird flu since mid-July while killing and disposing of millions of infected chickens, said public health officials on Thursday. “These preliminary results again underscore the risk of exposure to infected animals,” said the 
 (CDC), which added that the risk to the general population remains low.

 The 
 said that approximately 118 people have been tested for the avian flu virus and 10 cases have been confirmed — nine on poultry farms since July 12 and one on a dairy farm in May. The national total, which includes three workers on dairy farms in Michigan and Texas, is 13 since April. In addition, a Colorado correctional inmate was infected with the H5N1 virus while culling an infected chicken flock in 2022.

 All of the infected poultry workers were employed on egg farms in Weld County, northeast of Boulder — six on one farm and three on the other. The CDC and the Colorado Department of Public Health jointly announced confirmation of the outbreak among workers on the second farm.

 “The three confirmed cases occurred in people who were working directly with infected poultry at a commercial egg layer operation that had reported an outbreak of H5 bird flu among poultry,” said the CDC. “All three people have mild illness and have been offered the antiviral drug oseltamivir for treatment. State and local officials continue to monitor poultry workers on farms with infected poultry.”

 According to the CDC, “The risk to the general public from H5N1 [avian flu virus] remains low.” Genetic tests show that the virus has not changed in ways that would make it more communicable, it said, and there have been no signs of unexpected increases in flu activity in Colorado or the rest of the country.

 Highly pathogenic avian influenza has killed nearly 101 million birds in domestic flocks in 48 states since the disease appeared in the United States in February 2022. Some 172 dairy herds in 13 states have been diagnosed with H5N1 infections since late March. Fifty of them are in Colorado.

 For weeks, the CDC has said people working with infected or potentially infected livestock should wear protective gear. For jobs like culling infected flocks, workers should wear water-resistant coveralls, masks, goggles, gloves, and boots, it says. Officials have acknowledged that it is difficult to assure compliance during prolonged physical labor in hot weather.

 “Historically, most human cases of bird flu infection have happened in people who are not wearing recommended personal protective equipment,” said the CDC. Investigators will ask about the use of protective equipment on the Colorado farms, it said.

 Underground drainage tiling apparently failed and formed a sinkhole in a cornfield in northwest Iowa that allowed manure to flow into a creek, where it killed small fish for miles, according to the Iowa Department of Natural Resources.

 The manure came from Roorda Dairy, west of Paullina, which has about 4,200 dairy cattle, DNR records show. The dairy was irrigating a field with manure and didn’t notice the damaged tile line because of standing corn, said Tom Roos, a senior environmental specialist for the department.

 “With all these rain events, a tile line must have burst,” he said.

 Paullina is in O’Brien County in far northwest Iowa, parts of which have suffered severe flooding in recent weeks. The pressure from influxes of water into tile drains can cause weak areas to rupture, after which soil can flow into the tiling and create a sinkhole.

 On Wednesday, someone noticed dead fish in nearby Mud Creek and reported it to state law enforcement. A DNR investigation found that the manure had been flowing into the creek through the drainage tiling and killed fish along about nine miles of the stream, until it met another creek.

 It’s unclear how many gallons of manure might have spilled into the creek and how many fish it killed, Roos said. An investigation is ongoing.

 The dairy promptly plugged a culvert to prevent more manure from reaching the creek, Roos said. He did not know how long the spill had occurred.

 Roorda Dairy paid a $5,000 fine to the DNR in 2022 for starting construction on a manure digester without state approval. Digesters use bacteria to consume the manure and emit flammable gases, such as methane, that can be used to heat or power farm operations.

There were 26,290 dairy herds licensed to sell milk in 2023, compared to 70,375 herds in 2003; and milk production of 226.4 billion pounds last year was 33% larger than the 170.3 billion pounds two decades earlier.

 Texas and Idaho expanded production to become two of the five largest dairy states during that period, each with 7% of U.S. production. Meanwhile, California’s share of production dipped to 18%, a decline of 3 percentage points. Wisconsin produces 14% of U.S. milk today, up 1 point from 2002.

 There are fewer dairy cows nationwide but they each produce more milk, and very large dairy farms, with more than 2,000 head, are the source of 39% of the milk supply. Dairy farms tend to be larger in the West.

 “Not only have dairy farms become larger, but they have become more specialized in dairy production, lowering their production of other farm commodities and depending more heavily on purchased rather than homegrown feeds,” said the Economic Research Service report. “Larger dairy farms have tended to be more specialized in dairy production than smaller dairy farms and are the greater adopters of the most advanced technologies, management practices, and production systems.”

Noah Rohlfing," June was an all-time wet month for Minnesota farmers. 

 According to the 
, June 2024 was the fourth-wettest June on record in the state and the fifth-wettest month in recorded Minnesota history. The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) reported the average June rainfall throughout the state was 6.78 inches. 

 Kenny Blumenfeld, senior climatologist for Minnesota, said a stretch in the middle of the month contributed heavily to the large rainfall totals.

 “In addition to a persistent, active pattern, we got stuck in an eight-day pattern where it just rained really, really hard,” Blumenfeld said.

 The impact of the consistent heavy precipitation has been stark, with flooding happening throughout the state. A 
 said nearly half of Minnesota was in flooding conditions because of high water levels on the Missouri, Minnesota, and Mississippi rivers. Blumenfeld said that even before heavy June rains, there were reports of flooding in agricultural areas that resulted in equipment being submerged in some fields.

 In the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) Crop Progress report released on July 8, Minnesota only had 2.9 days suitable for fieldwork during the first week of July. 
 said, “Heavy rain and saturated soils continue to restrict access to fields throughout much of the state. Some livestock losses were reported due to flash flooding.”

 Blumenfeld said there has been difficulties for farmers with the sheer amount of rainfall and subsequent floods. 

 “I took a drive because I was giving a talk to an ag group in June during the wet spell,” Blumenfeld said. “I lost count after I got to 15 different flooded farm fields on a stretch two hours west of the Twin Cities.

 “Not every producer, not every farmer in the state, but certainly quite a few in southern Minnesota have had some difficulties because of very wet fields. Even if they have tile drainage, it was too wet for the tiles to shed effectively.”

 USDA’s most recent Crop Progress report said Minnesota was up to 4.7 workable field days as of July 14. Corn and soybean conditions have been steady, with 58% of corn in good/excellent condition and 58% of soybeans in good/excellent condition. 

 Corn silking is at 16%, 8 percentage points behind the five-year average of 24%. Soybeans are also blooming slower than the five year average of 51%, with progress at 46% as of July 14.

 Data from the Iowa Environmental Mesonet from June 1 to June 30 shows a higher surplus of precipitation in the western half of Minnesota. The hardest hit area, according to the map, was the southern tip of Minnesota, where areas experienced upwards of 10 inches more rainfall than the average.

 Blumenthal said farmers in the state are weary of returning to drought-like conditions like those in 2023, and are hesitant for rain to stop completely. 

 But, he said, a return to “stability” would be welcome for the rest of the summer. 

 The July outlook from the National Weather Service‘s Climate Prediction Center (CPC) has Minnesota still more likely to receive more precipitation than the yearly average and neither high nor low temperatures. This is in stark contrast to most of the Corn Belt, which has experienced multiple large-scale heat waves already through the first half of the month.

 Long-term forecasts and predictions from the CPC actually have Minnesota as likely to experience above-average temperatures through the July-August-September period. Precipitation outlooks put the state as middle of the road with no clear indications of dry or wet conditions.

 “Republicans’ funding bill for the Agriculture Department and the FDA, in addition to the Financial Services spending bill, will not be considered on the floor as originally planned, according to three sources familiar with the whipping problems,” Emma and Scholtes reported. “Both measures failed to clear the floor last summer, thanks to politically unpalatable funding levels and conservative policy riders, including language blocking abortion and contraceptive protections. Those same issues are ensnaring GOP leaders yet again, despite an effort to dial back on some of the more controversial provisions that previously stymied floor passage.”

 Politico’s Meredith Lee Hill wrote on the social media platform X that the main reason the bill was pulled from a House floor vote was that “conservatives wanted an amendment vote to re-add the controversial abortion pill rider centrist Rs had stripped out.”

 “Earlier this year, Republicans notably left out language in the funding bill that would have limited access to the abortion pill mifepristone, after a similar push helped doom their fiscal 2024 plan following pushback from moderates,” Folley and Brooks reported.

 “’I think that the major objections that often go for the reason it didn’t pass last year have been removed, so I don’t see a problem with it,’” (Rep. Andy Harris (R-Md.), chair of the subcommittee that crafted the Ag-FDA Bill), who is a member of the House Freedom Caucus, also said when pressed about the bill not including the mifepristone language,” Folley and Brooks reported.

 “But that hasn’t stopped others from taking issue with the move,” 
. “‘That’s one of the issues that I identified,’ Rep. Chip Roy (R-Texas), another member of the House Freedom Caucus, said when pressed on the matter, as well as his support for other measures. ‘My belief is, you got to figure that stuff out, and you got to know in the aggregate what you’re trying to accomplish,’ he said. ‘So, I think that bill’s currently stuck, and then we’ll have to kind of see what the deal is.'”

 
 that “rumors are already flying that GOP leaders might abandon their appropriations push altogether, leaving at the end of this week for August recess rather than stick around to sustain more self-inflicted spending wounds.”

 “One House Republican who spoke to The Hill said a leadership office told them ‘point-blank’ that the House will not return for votes next week,”

 In the Beige Book, released eight times a year, the 12 regional Fed banks report on economic conditions in their regions. The anecdotal reports are based on interviews with business contacts, economists, market experts, and other sources as well as on reports by the regional banks.

 “Farm income expectations for the district waned in late May and June as key crop prices declined,” said the Chicago Fed. “Contacts indicated that farmers were slow to sell crops from storage and were holding back on selling ahead from their anticipated fall harvest in part because of low prices.” Market prices for corn, soybeans, and wheat were down, and hog prices faltered. Milk and egg prices were up. “Cattle prices were flat at a high level,” said the Chicago Fed.

 The Minneapolis Fed said agricultural conditions had weakened since May. Ag lenders report “decreased farm incomes in the second quarter of 2024 relative to a year earlier, with expectations of further declines in the coming three months,” it said. Poultry producers were worried by outbreaks of bird flu in the region.

 “The latest planting estimates and favorable growing conditions suggested corn and soybean production could be strong, factors likely to weigh on prices,” said the Kansas City Fed. “Grain stocks from last year also remained elevated in district states and across the United States, putting additional downward pressure on prices and reducing revenue opportunities.” Cattle prices remained strong in the central Plains, so financial stress was lower in cattle-producing areas and higher on row-crop farms.

 The St. Louis Fed said crop conditions were stable “with high rainfall mitigating excessive heat. Contacts in agriculture equipment and services stated the slowdown in transactions relative to their peak in 2021-22 has continued.”

 U.S. net farm income, a gauge of profitability, is forecast by the USDA to fall in 2024 for the second year in a row from the record set in 2022. At $116.1 billion, it would be the fourth-highest level ever and 15% above its 10-year average in nominal terms.

 Agriculture conditions improved slightly in the U.S. Southeast, thanks to strong cattle, poultry, and dairy prices, said the Atlanta Fed. “Florida citrus farmers struggled as harvests were disappointing, leading to expectations of more growers leaving the market over the next year.” In the Southwest, drought has eased, and “livestock conditions were strong, with little to no supplemental feeding needed thanks to ample availability of grazing and hay, and cattle prices continued to strengthen,” said the Dallas Fed.

 On the West Coast, large inventories of apples, grapes, raisins, walnuts, almonds, and frozen salmon have depressed market prices below the cost of production, said the San Francisco Fed.

 An ethanol-producing facility in northeast Iowa expelled excessive pollutants into the air for several years that can cause cancers and other health effects, according to the Iowa Department of Natural Resources.

 “Actual harm to the environment and public health likely occurred,” the department said in a recent administrative order regarding POET Bioprocessing near Shell Rock.

 The facility makes about 140 million gallons of ethanol each year, along with other products from the leftover materials of the fuel production.

 The excessive pollution was tied to one of those additional products: a protein ingredient for animal feed.

 The facility’s previous operator, Flint Hills Resources, installed the equipment that is used to extract the protein and began operating it in July 2020, the DNR order said. However, part of the system lacked sufficient pollution controls, which was discovered by POET in August 2023. POET had purchased the facility about two years earlier, but did not sample the emissions.

 Flint Hills had underestimated the amount of pollutants in the ethanol-production leftovers that are used to produce the protein, said Mark Fields, a unit leader for the DNR’s Air Quality Bureau. Those pollutants were then expelled during the protein processing.

 Fields said the issue was discovered with a similar system in another state, and POET shut down the production line and notified the DNR. The company later routed those emissions into an existing pollution-control system at the plant and fixed the problem.

 But emissions tests after the production line was reactivated revealed the extent of the excessive pollution in the previous years: Its volatile organic compounds emissions were 27 times its permitted limit, and emissions of a hazardous, cancer-causing compound — acetaldehyde — were nearly nine times the limit.

 The POET facility lies about two miles northwest of Shell Rock, and about five miles west of Waverly.

 POET agreed to pay a $10,000 administrative fine, the DNR order said. It also will pay nearly $43,000 in fees that it owed the state for its underreporting of emissions in 2021 and 2022.

 The company did not immediately respond to a request to comment for this article.

 Still, ample rain has fallen in parts of the U.S. Corn Belt — too much in some areas, as flooding is ongoing — that has kept crops hydrated. 

 Soybean futures for November delivery jumped 19½¢ to $10.55½ a bushel overnight on the Chicago Board of Trade (CBOT). Soymeal added $6.20 to $313.70 a short ton, and soy oil was up 0.57¢ to 44.54¢ a pound. 

 Corn futures for December delivery gained 6½¢ to $4.11¼ a bushel.

 Wheat futures for September delivery rose 4¢ to $5.46¾ a bushel, while Kansas City futures added 1¾¢ to $5.71¾ a bushel. 

 Investors reduced their net-short positions, or bets on lower prices, in corn futures in the seven days that ended July 16, according to the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC).

 Speculators held a net 352,772 futures contracts in corn, down from 356,415 contracts a week earlier, the agency said. 

 Money managers raised their bearish bets on soybean futures to 183,145 futures contracts, CFTC said. That’s up from 162,803 contracts the week prior. 

 In wheat, investors were more bearish week to week. 

 Hedge fund managers and other large investment firms held 72,831 futures contracts in soft red winter wheat, up from 68,692 contracts seven days earlier. 

 Investors held 44,624 hard red winter wheat contracts, up from 40,893 contracts the previous week, CFTC said in its report. 

 The weekly Commitment of Traders report from the CFTC shows trader positions in futures markets.

 The report provides positions held by commercial traders, or those using futures to hedge their physical assets; noncommercial traders, or money managers (also called large speculators); and nonreportables, or small speculators.

 A net-long position indicates more traders are betting on higher prices, while a net-short position means more are betting futures will decline.

Chuck Abbott," The EPA will have to take a new look at requests for three dozen “hardship” exemptions from the ethanol mandate under a ruling by the U.S appeals court in Washington. Ethanol makers, “extremely disappointed” by the ruling, said they were considering a response, “which may include seeking further review of today’s decision.”

 At issue was EPA’s denial in April 2022 of 36 requests by small refiners for a waiver from the Renewable Fuel Standard requirement to blend biofuels into gasoline for cars and pickup trucks. At the time, the EPA said the refineries did not face disproportionate economic harm if they had to buy credits, known as RINs, to make up for their failure to mix enough ethanol into gasoline.

 The appellate court vacated the denials on Friday and ordered the cases remanded to the EPA for further proceedings. The court opinion was sealed from public view so the its reasoning and specific instruction to EPA were not known. In April, judges on the appeals court questioned whether the EPA was overly strict in determining if a refiner faced financial hardship in complying with the RFS, reported 
.

 “EPA’s decision in 2022 to deny the petitions was well-reasoned, based on sound economic analysis, and consistent with the Clean Air Act and the objectives of the Renewable Fuel Standard,” said 
—the American Coalition for Ethanol, Growth Energy, and the Renewable Fuels Association. “We will evaluate our next steps, which may include seeking further review of today’s decision. Our coalition remains resolute and committed to protecting and defending the proper implementation of the RFS.”

 During the Trump era, the EPA issued dozens of waivers from the RFS. Biofuel advocates said the exemptions amounted to a 1.4-billion-gallon reduction in ethanol demand at a time when the RFS generally set a target of blending 15 billion gallons a year of corn ethanol into motor fuel. When it took office, the Biden administration indicated it would be more stringent in evaluating requests for exemptions.

 Involved in the EPA’s decision in 2022 were exemptions granted by Trump officials for RFS obligations in 2018. The 36 exemptions were part of a Supreme Court ruling in 2021 on EPA discretion to issue RFS waivers. Based on that ruling, an appeals court told the EPA to decide by April 7, 2022, on whether or grant or deny them. The 
 and said it would create an alternative method of compliance for 31 refiners that did not require them to buy or retire RINs.

 In addition to remanding the exemptions to the EPA, the appellate court also dismissed a lawsuit challenging the EPA alternate method of compliance.

 Legislators, counties, conservation groups and landowners have asked state regulators to reconsider their permit approval for an expansive carbon dioxide pipeline system in Iowa.

 A total of eight requests were filed with the Iowa Utilities Commission in the past week before a procedural deadline on Monday, and they 
 to lawsuits in state court.

 The commission last month 
 by Summit Carbon Solutions to construct about 690 miles of pipe in Iowa to transport captured carbon dioxide from ethanol plants. The company has already 
 its footprint by more than 300 feet to connect to more of the facilities.

 The reconsideration requests were filed by:

 — 
, a conservation group that has been key to organizing opposition to the project.
— 
, a group of 26 state representatives and 11 state senators who oppose the use of eminent domain for the project.
— 
, an attorney who is the leading representative of affected landowners who oppose the project.
— 
, an attorney who represents Dickinson, Emmet, Floyd, Kossuth, Shelby, Woodbury and Wright counties.
— 
— 
, a landowner in Emmet County.
— 
, landowners in Lyon County.
— 
, which was originally formed to oppose the Dakota Access oil pipeline. It advocates for climate change solutions and opposes eminent domain for the pipelines.

 Opposition to the use of eminent domain — in which Summit will be able to force unwilling landowners to host its pipeline network — is a common thread of the objections. A Des Moines Register/Mediacom Iowa Poll last year showed that 78% of Iowans 
.

 “The bottom line is that a private entity like Summit cannot be granted the power of eminent domain unless it is a common carrier,” the Sierra Club wrote in its Monday reconsideration request. “But the evidence showed that Summit is not a common carrier. It will be contracting individually with ethanol plants, not the public generally, and it will own the carbon dioxide, so it will be carrying its own product, not carrying a product for hire.”

 The IUC used a self-designed “balancing test” that considered a number of factors to determine whether the project benefits the public. That test 
 a permit for Summit, and those who oppose the project say its conclusions were flawed.

 The group of Republican lawmakers further said the IUC’s process precluded input from many people who might be affected by the project, including those who live close enough to the pipeline route to be threatened by a potential pipeline breach but far enough away to not be in the pipeline’s direct path.

 Catastrophic pipeline failures

 “A significant number of Iowans – those who are in the kill zone but who are not yet aware of their status – have been excluded from even rudimentary due process in the IUC’s consideration of the Summit application,” the lawmakers wrote.

 The three-member IUC has 30 days to respond to the requests, after which the groups can take their objections to court.

 Summit wants to lay about 2,500 miles of pipe in five states to transport the greenhouse gas to North Dakota for underground storage. It has not yet obtained permits in North and South Dakota, which is a requirement for the company to start construction in Iowa.

XtremeAg," XtremeAg farmers in Maryland and North Carolina manage impact of drought on early planted corn and soybeans.

 


 The drought continues. The forecast has been very encouraging, 40% to 70% chance of precipitation at least 9 or 10 days of the 12-day forecast. If you’re fortunate enough to receive a rain shower in this area, they are light. Seems like they fall in the same area, but we are fortunate that some farms received rain.

 Irrigation has been a blessing on those few acres that have not received any showers, however this is our first crop to be totally raised on irrigation and let me tell you, if a drip tape or sprinkler isn’t doing its job the crop will show you quickly. Our early corn is very rough, and the mid plantings are fair with the later just begging for rains before it tassels. Those acres are getting Veltyma, BoronMax with Fulltec, Finishline, Sweet Success, and of course, Terramar to help it begin a successful pollination.

 Soybeans continue to hold on. The deer damage is horrendous, they can eat them faster than they can grow with such little moisture. It’s interesting that this year the deer are going after the corn over the soybeans. If they have a choice, we think the soybeans are just tough with little moisture and they chew on the corn stalks while leaving the leaves of the plant laying on the ground! I’ve never seen this widespread issue before.


 


 We have now entered the fourth quarter of the 2024 crop. It has definitely been a challenging year. Wet early and dry late. We had high hopes to get some moisture from tropical storm Beryl, but we did not have success.


 Our corn is approaching black layer and the soybeans are at R6. The February-planted soybeans will get one more watering and then desiccation. Looking back, I wish I had planted 1,000 acres at that time, but you just never know.

 I do think that our soybean crop looks really good, but the corn may be a little off this year. It had such a rough start, and never really made that difference up. We are forecasted to have a really hot and dry September, which should aid in a good harvest. We are about 30 to 45 days out in corn harvest, so I will definitely know something soon.


 


 Early-planted corn on the east coast is extremely bad. The drought area affected goes from Pennsylvania to Georgia. It’s the worst I’ve ever seen in my career as a farmer. A lot of areas are a zero yield. We have a little bit of rain relieving heat and drought for a small amount of time and it could help late-May-planted corn, but we think the damage has been done at this point.

 The early-planted soybeans struggled with wet weather early, then severe drought. Soybeans are extremely short and struggled to canopy. Somehow, they are still holding on for the time being. There was a window in mid- to late May where the soybeans were planted that actually look fair. A fair amount of double crop soybeans was replanted because there was just enough moisture at planting to germinate them, then they died.


 All in all, the crops in the east are a complete disaster.

Mariah Squire," Corn conditions in North Carolina are still the worst of any top-producing state by far. The state had the greatest percentages of Very Poor and Poor corn, as well as the lowest percentages of Good and Excellent corn the week ending July 21.

 However, its combined percentage of Very Poor/Poor corn decreased for the first time since early June, indicating an overall improvement of corn condition.


 According to the most recent Crop Progress report, for the week ending July 21, the USDA rated North Carolina’s corn as follows: 31% Very Poor, 35% Poor, 19% Fair, 14% Good, and 1% Excellent. That compares with ratings from the week prior: 44% Very Poor, 29% Poor, 18% Fair, 9% Good, and 0% Excellent.


 Recent more favorable weather has played a role in the improvement, according to Kathie Dello, North Carolina’s state climatologist and the director of the North Carolina State Climate Office. “We’ve been lucky to return to a cooler, more showery weather pattern for the second half of July — bringing some much needed relief to our producers,” Dello says.


 Other North Carolina crops also showed some improvement.


 
For the week ending July 21, the USDA rated North Carolina soybeans as follows: 5% Very Poor, 16% Poor, 34% Fair, 40% Good, and 5% Excellent. That’s much improved compared with the week ending July 14. At that point, soybeans were rated 7% Very Poor, 24% Poor, 43% Fair, 26% Good, and 0% Excellent. 


 
For the week ending July 21, the USDA rated North Carolina peanuts as follows: 3% Very Poor, 4% Poor, 32% Fair, 54% Good, and 7% Excellent. The week prior, ending July 14, a combined total of 12% of the peanut crop were rated Very Poor/Poor. Only 46% were rated Good, and and 4% were rated Excellent. 


 
 For the week ending July 21, the USDA rated pasture and range for the state as follows: 6% Very Poor, 18% Poor, 59% Fair, 16% Good, and 1% Excellent. Those conditions are far better than the week ending July 14. At that point they were rated 12% Very Poor, 43% Poor, 32% Fair, 13% Good, and 0% Excellent.


 Thomas Shaw raises flue-cured tobacco, corn, soybeans, and wheat in north-central Vance County, by the Virginia border. Shaw explained why he described his corn as “severely damaged.”

 “In June, we had extreme drought and temperatures here and that really damaged our corn.” Shaw said. He added that although a rainy July helped some of the corn recover, the overall condition remains “very poor,” and he says he doesn’t have high hopes for much of a yield. 


 The weather also has adversely affected Shaw’s soybeans, especially his double crop behind wheat. Hot, dry weather was an issue even before June: In April it delayed planting. “The first planted beans are starting to bloom, but they don’t have much size [at] all to them,” Shaw says. He added that the soybean canopies are not forming, as they should be. Like corn, he does not expect much yield.


 While June was hot and dry, July has seen excessive rain. “We went from one extreme to the other,” he said. It’s now affecting the ability to spray for weeds.


 Shaw says he’s hopeful some of his soybeans can recover. However, he knows sufficient rain and suitable temperatures were lacking during a critical window for corn. “Corn, you know,” he says, “that doesn’t come back.”


 David Hight raises tobacco, peppers, corn, soybeans, and wheat in Warren County, northeast of Raleigh by the Virginia state line. He described his corn to be “in terrible shape.” The poor weather’s timing exacerbated the effect.

 “The hottest and driest point of the year was during pollination, and a lot of our corn didn’t pollinate,” he says. He explains that his crops got very little rain from May 20 until July 4. In one location he measured during that period, the total precipitation was 0.60 inches. With that and temperatures of 90°F to 100°F almost every day, the weather absolutely took a toll, he says, especially on corn.


 Like Shaw, Hight says dry weather through April negatively affected planting, and additional dryness since then even forced some replanting. “These beans [have] a long way to go,” he says. 


 Also like Shaw, Hight says his crops have received some much needed rain in July — but almost too much. “We’ve been getting good rain, actually to the point we really need it to slow down a little bit,” he says. But, “We really can’t get work done because of it.”


 Hight says this year’s conditions remind him of 2010, except that year provided no respite by rain, as this July has. He went on to say that last month ranks as one of the driest Junes he’s seen in his lifetime.


 Melissa Simmons is a crop insurance specialist for the North Carolina Farm Bureau and works with producers in the northern part of the state. She’s been selling crop insurance since 2015 and says producers are being very proactive when it comes to insurance claims.

 “We definitely are filing claims much sooner than we normally would because of the drought,” she says, spurred by the corn’s small cob size along with the crop’s declining price. Early planted corn has been affected the most, she says. The affected corn was at the tasseling stage when the drought occurred.


 Simmons says a coworker who covers the southern part of North Carolina has filed claims on behalf of nearly all his corn producers. “It's good to go ahead and file those claims early because we don’t know what the future holds,"" she says. “We don’t know how much it will recover.”

 Exporters of agricultural products from the U.S. may have a new customer in mind, one that most wouldn’t think as a destination: Venezuela. 

 The country was the sixth-biggest importer of U.S. agricultural products in South America last year, importing $670 million worth of goods, USDA said in an attaché report from its Caracas office. While that's down 10% year over year, growth opportunities abound. 

 “Venezuela continues to grow its retail sector, supermarkets are well stocked, and U.S. brand awareness and acceptance have increased over the last two years,” the report said. 

 Agricultural imports by the South American country have the potential to improve moving forward, and the U.S. is well positioned due to product pricing, quality, and geographical proximity, USDA said. 

 U.S. companies stand to benefit from the popularity of products from the States and a “de facto dollarization of the Venezuelan economy,” the agency said. More than 60% of the country’s food is derived from imports and shipments from the U.S. can arrive in three to five days, a much shorter timeframe than other suppliers. 

 Still, there are challenges: Venezuela has trade agreements with countries in South and Central America, inflation and devaluation have hurt consumer purchases, and the country’s processes for permitting and registering certain ag or food items can be cumbersome, USDA said. 

 Flood warnings and watches have been issued for parts of southern Missouri, southern Illinois and northern Arkansas, according to the National Weather Service. 

 Storms are forecast in the region this morning with some producing large hail and winds up to 60 mph, the agency said. 

 As much as 5 inches of precipitation fell in the overnight hours and another 1 to 3 inches of rain are expected per hour this morning. Flooding is ongoing in some areas. 

 In the southern Plains, strong storms are likely this afternoon, mostly in the western Texas and Oklahoma panhandles, NWS said.

This is 12.2% lower than last year’s output. The second corn crop was down 3.4% from the previous forecast to 88 mmt.

 The drop in production is attributed to a year with “intensified El Niño with an influence over the crops since the early plantings,” according to Conab.

 Harvest of safrinha — the second corn crop — is underway. In Mato Grosso, the largest corn producing state, harvest is 76% complete with 45% of the new crop sold, according to consultancy AgRural. Favorable weather has helped spur harvest along. This has not been the case in Mato Grosso do Sul where harvest is only 29% complete.

 In Paraná, the only southern state that plants safrinha, many regions have gone 40 days without rain, according to a local government agency. Harvest is underway with 66% complete and 21% of the crop is considered under poor conditions. 


 Rain is in the forecast for this week in Paraná, according to Climatempo. West-central states, such as Mato Grosso, Mato Grosso do Sul, and Goiás, may face storms, which could mean multiple harvest delays this week.


 The main talking point in the market among producers is the currency devaluation and its impact on the price received by producers. On July 12, 1 U.S. dollar would buy 5.42 Brazilian real. In January, $1 could purchase 4.95 Brazilian real.


 While the amount received in local currency has increased due to currency devaluation, fertilizer costs are down, reducing the amount spent on inputs.

Tony Dreibus," Corn and soybean futures were modestly lower in overnight trading as rainfall in the northern and central Midwest offset concerns about extremely hot weather in the South. 

 Rain fell in parts of Nebraska, Iowa, and Illinois throughout the week and more precipitation is expected. 

 More showers and storms are expected today in parts of Illinois, Indiana, Kentucky, and southwestern Ohio, the National Weather Service said in a statement this morning. 

 Iowa is free of dry or drought conditions and less than 3% of Illinois is seeing abnormally dry weather, according to the U.S. Drought Monitor, which is scheduled to update its maps today. 

 Underpinning prices, however, are concerns about the severity and frequency of thunderstorms that have rolled through parts of the Midwest in recent days. 

 More severe weather, including intense downpours and flash flooding, is possible with today’s storms, the agency said. 

 “Many of these locations have seen recent heavy rainfall given repeated rounds of organized storms passing through, leading to wetter antecedent conditions more sensitive to additional rainfall,” NWS said. 

 Corn futures for December delivery fell 1¼¢ to $3.98½ a bushel overnight on the Chicago Board of Trade.

 Soybean futures for November delivery lost 2¾¢ to $10.19¾ a bushel. Soymeal gained 60¢ to $316.30 a short ton and soy oil was down 0.34¢ to 41.98¢ a pound. 

 Wheat futures for September delivery gained 2¾¢ to $5.30 a bushel, while Kansas City futures rose 1¾¢ to $5.50¾ a bushel. 

 Ethanol output surged to a record high in the week that ended on July 26, according to the Energy Information Administration.

 Production of the corn-based biofuel improved to an average of 1.109 million barrels a day, the agency said in a report. That’s up from 1.095 million barrels the previous week and the highest level on record. 

 In the Midwest, by far the biggest producing region, output increased to 1.045 million barrels per day, on average, from 1.035 million a week earlier. 

 Gulf Coast production rose to 29,000 barrels from 26,000 a week earlier, EIA said. 

 Rocky Mountain output was reported at 13,000 barrels a day from 12,000 barrels the week prior, and West Coast production improved to 10,000 barrels from 9,000 barrels, the agency said.

 East Coast was again unchanged at 12,000 barrels per day. 

 USDA said in a report last month that it expects ethanol makers to use 5.45 billion bushels of corn for ethanol production in the 2024/2025 marketing year that starts on Sept. 1. If realized that would be unchanged from the current year, but up from the 5.176 billion bushels used in the 2022/2023 marketing year. 

 Ethanol inventories in the week through July 26 increased to 23.973 million barrels, the government said. 

 That’s up from 23.723 million a week earlier and the highest level for stockpiles since the week that ended on May 17, EIA said in its report. 

 Flood warnings and watches have been issued for counties in southeastern Iowa as rain continues to fall in the area, according to the National Weather Service. 

 “Excessive runoff may result in flooding of rivers, creeks, streams and other low-lying and flood-prone locations,” the agency said. “Creeks and streams may rise out of their banks.” 

 Soils are saturated from precipitation yesterday and more storms are on the way, NWS said. 

 Heat warnings and advisories will again take effect today for much of the southern Midwest and the Delta. 

 In southern Missouri and Illinois, heat indexes this afternoon are forecast to hit as high as 110° Fahrenheit, the agency said.

 An ethanol-producing facility in northeast Iowa expelled excessive pollutants into the air for several years that can cause cancers and other health effects, according to the Iowa Department of Natural Resources.

 “Actual harm to the environment and public health likely occurred,” the department said in a recent administrative order regarding POET Bioprocessing near Shell Rock.

 The facility makes about 140 million gallons of ethanol each year, along with other products from the leftover materials of the fuel production.

 The excessive pollution was tied to one of those additional products: a protein ingredient for animal feed.

 The facility’s previous operator, Flint Hills Resources, installed the equipment that is used to extract the protein and began operating it in July 2020, the DNR order said. However, part of the system lacked sufficient pollution controls, which was discovered by POET in August 2023. POET had purchased the facility about two years earlier, but did not sample the emissions.

 Flint Hills had underestimated the amount of pollutants in the ethanol-production leftovers that are used to produce the protein, said Mark Fields, a unit leader for the DNR’s Air Quality Bureau. Those pollutants were then expelled during the protein processing.

 Fields said the issue was discovered with a similar system in another state, and POET shut down the production line and notified the DNR. The company later routed those emissions into an existing pollution-control system at the plant and fixed the problem.

 But emissions tests after the production line was reactivated revealed the extent of the excessive pollution in the previous years: Its volatile organic compounds emissions were 27 times its permitted limit, and emissions of a hazardous, cancer-causing compound — acetaldehyde — were nearly nine times the limit.

 The POET facility lies about two miles northwest of Shell Rock, and about five miles west of Waverly.

 POET agreed to pay a $10,000 administrative fine, the DNR order said. It also will pay nearly $43,000 in fees that it owed the state for its underreporting of emissions in 2021 and 2022.

 The company did not immediately respond to a request to comment for this article.

Chuck Abbott," U.S. agriculture has turned increasingly to short-term guest workers to relieve a labor shortage in recent years. Farm groups and farm state lawmakers want to expand the program. The Republican platform does not mention agricultural workers while pledging strong immigration laws. 
, which describes itself as a blueprint for a new Trump administration, says the H-2A agricultural visa should be phased out over the next 10 to 20 years.

 Approximately 310,000 H-2A visas were issued by the State Department in 2023, up from 298,000 visas in 2022 and four times more than the 75,000 visas in 2010. Farmers say they have turned to the H-2A program because of the difficulty in recruiting farm labor. Half of farmworkers are believed to be undocumented, and many are reaching retirement age. The 275,000 H-2A guest workers of 2020 accounted for 10% of the average employment on crop farms, according to a 
.

 In March, a 
 unanimously recommended that the H-2A visa, now limited to seasonal work, also be available for year-round work on farms and in processing plants. “One thing that has become clear is the need for dairy products, meat processors, sugar processors, forestry, ranchers, and others to have access to a steady and legal workforce,” said the working group, composed of members of the House Agriculture Committee.

 Action is needed to “reform the H-2A wage system to reflect real-world wages better, while protecting against sudden wage increases that disrupt employer planning and operations,” said the working group. It suggested a wage freeze for 2025, followed by yearly increases of no more than 3.25% through 2029.

 The Trump administration proposed a two-year wage freeze for guest workers in 2020, just before the presidential election. Then Agriculture Secretary Sonny Perdue said the Labor Department regulation demonstrated “President Trump’s commitment to America’s farmers by delivering lower costs when they need it the most.” The minimum pay rates set by the Labor Department, known as adverse effect wage rates, are intended to prevent H-2A wages from undermining pay for American workers.

 Farmers frequently say the wage rates are burdensomely high. The American Farm Bureau Federation said it “supports short-term relief in the form of a justified pause in the minimum wage rate.” The H-2A program should be reformed to provide “flexibility for employers and workers by allowing employment options to address seasonal and year-round needs and a reasonable and mutually agreeable wage rate.”

 To the contrary, Project 2025 says, “The low cost of H-2A workers undercuts American workers in agricultural employment.”

 “Congress should immediately cap this program at its current levels and establish a schedule for its gradual and predictable phase-down over the subsequent 10 to 20 years, producing the necessary incentives for the industry to invest in raising productivity, including through capital investment in agricultural equipment, and increasing employment for Americans in the agricultural sector,” said Project 2025, shepherded by the Heritage Foundation. The Project 2025 chapter on the Labor Department notes the alternative argument that without guest workers, farmers would have to increase wages drastically and even then, not be certain of finding enough U.S.-born workers to bring food products to the market.

 The 16-page 
, adopted a week ago, vows “the largest deportation operation in American history” and to “sending illegal aliens back home.” Republicans say they would complete the border wall with Mexico, make border enforcement a high priority for law enforcement and the military and subject people entering the country legally to “strict vetting.” The platform endorses merit-based immigration. “We will end chain migration, and put American workers first,” it said.

 The costs, time, and disruptions involved in deporting millions of people would be enormous, said the 
. One immigration expert said it would take billions of dollars and as long as 20 years to accomplish. During Trump’s tenure in office, the United States deported 936,000 people. Congress allotted $3.4 billion this year for deportation facilities holding an average 41,500 immigrants.

 As avian influenza is being detected in more and more dairy herds across the U.S., Iowa State University researchers have found a possible “why” connection to the virus being found in raw milk.

 A study published this month by a team in ISU’s College of Veterinary Medicine found that bovine mammary gland tissue held receptors for the avian influenza virus, offering a potential explanation for how cattle are being infected.

 Todd Bell, a professor of veterinary pathology and co-author of the study, said the idea to look at mammary glands as a potential entry point for the virus came after it was identified in raw milk. Two ISU alums in the spring identified an illness impacting cattle in Texas as 
, and ever since different teams at the university and in partnerships with other organizations have been working to tackle the virus and its spread from different angles.

 “They really answered the ‘what,’ what was actually going on, what was making these cattle sick, which is a new and novel finding, and then our job, really, at that point as researchers was to understand the ‘why,’” Bell said. “We’ve never seen this before. Why is this happening?”

 To understand the concept, Bell suggested thinking of viruses as like keys, and receptors are like locks to cells. In order for the avian flu virus to enter a cell and reproduce, it needs the right receptor. The research team found that receptor on cattle mammary glands.

 Another receptor they found is connected to human influenza, Bell said, which is important because it opens up the possibility of a cell being infected by both viruses, potentially causing the creation of a new virus.

 “To our knowledge, that hasn’t happened yet in this particular outbreak, but we wanted to look for those receptors to understand what might be possible and hopefully stop the transmission and stop that from happening,” Bell said.

 The team also looked at the respiratory system to try and identify evidence of the bird flu, but found little there, narrowing down the possibilities of how cattle are being infected.

 According to the 
, as of July 12 the avian influenza had been detected in dairy herds in 12 states, including 13 herds in Iowa. While the virus is being detected in raw milk, the pasteurization process ensures it is safe to be consumed.

 While Bell and his colleague’s work is still very much focused on the “why” of avian flu in dairy herds and its spread, he said the hope is that their research will help inform regulators in making decisions on testing and biosecurity measures to try and stop the spread of the virus. He said there is some literature that states the virus can live on milking machines for a few hours after an infected cow is hooked up to them, offering one potential method of spread.

 “We hope that what we find will help them make those types of decisions, specifically if we can find it in mammary tissue, then how do we stop it from getting to that mammary tissue in the first place,” Bell said.

 Next steps for Bell and his colleagues include looking at the milk and mammary glands of other domestic animals, like sheep and goats, to see if they also carry receptors for the avian flu. Bell said they will also look at their respiratory systems and gastrointestinal tracts to see if the flu could have other points of entry, like if a wild bird with the virus defecates into a water supply and farm animals drink the infected water.

 Iowa Secretary of Agriculture Mike Naig said during “
” last week that longitudinal studies are also being conducted on farms to test every single animal housed there in order to track how the virus moves and determine how it exits the herd.

 “Because it will, it will eventually exit that herd and you want to be able to track those things and have an expectation of how long does that last,” he said during the program.

 With the USDA cancelling its regularly scheduled July cattle inventory report due to budget cuts, a question that many would like to have answered is: How big is the U.S. cattle herd?

 Fortunately, historical relationships between changes in prior and subsequent inventories and levels of cow slaughter in between or heifers’ share of cattle on feed offer some indication. These negative relationships respectively explain 30% and 50% of the variation in changes in cattle inventory from one July to the next. While the share of January cow inventory that is slaughtered by July has dropped from 8.75% in 2003 to 7.76% in 2004, suggesting a slowing of cow herd liquidation, the current level still corresponds to a reduction in the July over July total inventory, as does the proportion of feedlot cattle that are heifers, currently at 39.6% compared to 39.9% last July.

 A model incorporating both variables explains 61% of inventory changes and estimates the July 1 U.S. cattle inventory to be 94.2 million head or 1.2% lower than in July 2023.
 Hence, it appears the U.S. cattle industry overall remains in a contractionary phase, even if there may be regional pockets of expansion.

 The USDA’s most recent Cattle on Feed report indicates that feedlots placed 1.56 million head on-feed and marketed 1.79 million last June or about 7% fewer placements and 9% fewer marketings than in the prior June, bringing the July 1 total number of cattle on feed to 11.3 million head or just about 1% more than last July.

 With a 0.8% increase in steers on-feed relative to last July and a nearly unchanged (0.1% increase) number of heifers, the latter’s share of cattle on feed, as already mentioned, also remains similar to a year ago at nearly 40%, as compared to only 31%-33% during much of the last expansion. Such a statistic typically indicates a reduction in replacement heifers, as producers remain reluctant to rebuild the breeding herd.

 Given the low inventory and cattle on feed numbers, beef production is anticipated to be 1.1% lower in 2024 than last year and then drop another 4.5% in 2025. Accordingly, per capita beef consumption is expected remain near 58 pounds per person in 2024 and then decrease 3.26% to 56.3 pounds per person in 2025. Based on stronger than anticipated global demand, the USDA in its Livestock, Dairy, and Poultry Outlook revised projections of beef exports upward, now just 4.3% lower this year than the last and left unchanged a further 14.0% projected decline for 2025.

 Following records in 2021 and again in 2022, beef exports dropped about 14.3% lower in 2023, and the 2024 projection returns to within 1.5% of the 2020 level, while projected declines for 2025 bring beef exports down to levels not seen since 2016. Still, as a result of currently strong demand and declining production, cold stocks of beef are already fairly low. According to the USDA’s June Cold Storage Report beef stocks on May 31 are down 3.4% from a month earlier and 0.5% from last year.

 All things considered, prices are likely to remain above year ago levels. Quarterly prices for slaughter steers are forecast to average about $191.48/cwt and $199.08/cwt for the last two quarters of 2024, and $204.60/cwt and $209.12/cwt for the first two quarters of 2025. For 600-700 pound feeder steers, prices are forecast to average about $286.38/cwt and $277.88/cwt for the last two quarters of 2024, and $293.31/cwt and $301.50/cwt for the first two quarters of 2025.

 These projections reflect tight supplies and declining but resilient domestic consumption and export demand. If demand declines even more than anticipated or a larger herd exists than indicated by this analysis, then lower prices may result.

 Legislators, counties, conservation groups and landowners have asked state regulators to reconsider their permit approval for an expansive carbon dioxide pipeline system in Iowa.

 A total of eight requests were filed with the Iowa Utilities Commission in the past week before a procedural deadline on Monday, and they 
 to lawsuits in state court.

 The commission last month 
 by Summit Carbon Solutions to construct about 690 miles of pipe in Iowa to transport captured carbon dioxide from ethanol plants. The company has already 
 its footprint by more than 300 feet to connect to more of the facilities.

 The reconsideration requests were filed by:

 — 
, a conservation group that has been key to organizing opposition to the project.
— 
, a group of 26 state representatives and 11 state senators who oppose the use of eminent domain for the project.
— 
, an attorney who is the leading representative of affected landowners who oppose the project.
— 
, an attorney who represents Dickinson, Emmet, Floyd, Kossuth, Shelby, Woodbury and Wright counties.
— 
— 
, a landowner in Emmet County.
— 
, landowners in Lyon County.
— 
, which was originally formed to oppose the Dakota Access oil pipeline. It advocates for climate change solutions and opposes eminent domain for the pipelines.

 Opposition to the use of eminent domain — in which Summit will be able to force unwilling landowners to host its pipeline network — is a common thread of the objections. A Des Moines Register/Mediacom Iowa Poll last year showed that 78% of Iowans 
.

 “The bottom line is that a private entity like Summit cannot be granted the power of eminent domain unless it is a common carrier,” the Sierra Club wrote in its Monday reconsideration request. “But the evidence showed that Summit is not a common carrier. It will be contracting individually with ethanol plants, not the public generally, and it will own the carbon dioxide, so it will be carrying its own product, not carrying a product for hire.”

 The IUC used a self-designed “balancing test” that considered a number of factors to determine whether the project benefits the public. That test 
 a permit for Summit, and those who oppose the project say its conclusions were flawed.

 The group of Republican lawmakers further said the IUC’s process precluded input from many people who might be affected by the project, including those who live close enough to the pipeline route to be threatened by a potential pipeline breach but far enough away to not be in the pipeline’s direct path.

 Catastrophic pipeline failures

 “A significant number of Iowans – those who are in the kill zone but who are not yet aware of their status – have been excluded from even rudimentary due process in the IUC’s consideration of the Summit application,” the lawmakers wrote.

 The three-member IUC has 30 days to respond to the requests, after which the groups can take their objections to court.

 Summit wants to lay about 2,500 miles of pipe in five states to transport the greenhouse gas to North Dakota for underground storage. It has not yet obtained permits in North and South Dakota, which is a requirement for the company to start construction in Iowa.

Chuck Abbott," Except for the “lame duck long shot” of a post-election compromise, the slim chances that Congress will pass a new farm bill this year “have become nonexistent,” farm policy expert 
 said Thursday. The primary reason is the “long-unspecified demand” by Republicans for higher crop subsidy spending without providing details, wrote Coppess, a USDA official during the Obama era, at the farmdoc daily blog.

 Progress on the farm bill was also mired in disagreements over SNAP cuts and climate funding. Congress is nearly 10 months late in replacing the 2018 farm law.

 Earlier this week during a 
, House Agriculture Committee chair Glenn Thompson (R-Pa.) said it would be September before the farm bill is debated in the House. The senior Republican on the Senate Agriculture Committee, John Boozman of Arkansas, said, “If we can’t make a meaningful change” in the so-called reference prices that trigger subsidy payments, “I think we’re better off with an extension” of current law into 2025.

 The already slim chances of farm bill reauthorization in 2024 “are wilting in the summer heat, facing a legislative calendar almost out of days,” Coppess said. He added that the farm bill approved by the House Agriculture Committee on May 24 “lacks a viable path with the budget and political problems facing it.”

 The bill would increase crop subsidy and crop insurance outlays by one-third from current levels but offsets only part of the cost, according to the Congressional Budget Office. The bill also would cut SNAP spending. House Republicans unsuccessfully sought SNAP cuts in the 2014 and 2018 farm laws.

 “All that remains is an outside chance” of agreement on a farm bill after the Nov. 5 general election —the “lame duck long shot,” Coppess said. “It is more likely that any lame duck session will merely extend the 2018 farm bill again.”

 The farm bill is on the back burner in Congress, where annual government funding bills are at the top of the agenda. There has been little urgency in farm bill discussions.

 Higher reference prices and an expansion of crop insurance are long-standing farm bill priorities for farm groups. Lawmakers from farm states have often said they want “more farm in the farm bill.” Months passed, however, without a public statement of how large an increase was wanted in reference prices or how to pay for it.

 Boozman proposed a 15% increase in reference prices for row crops, such as corn, soybeans, and wheat, as part of a 
 released in June. The Republican-written farm bill in the House also calls for a 15% increase. Republican staff workers on the Senate Agriculture Committee said the cost of higher reference prices could be offset through savings in the farm bill baseline of $1.4 billion over 10 years.

 In an outline released in May, Senate Agriculture Committee chair 
 (D-Mich.) said the major row crops should be assured of a 5% increase in reference prices, and she said she had the $5 billion to cover the cost. In late June, she said an extension of the 2018 farm bill might be necessary because of inaction on the new farm bill.

 “Republicans are breaking the farm and food coalition by falsely claiming that increased program cost for food security through SNAP has somehow taken resources away from farms or left farms out of the mix,” Stabenow said. “Such a framing is disingenuous and misleading.”

 that “House Republicans have pulled two government funding bills scheduled for a floor vote this week, signaling further peril for leadership’s doomed efforts to pass all 2025 spending measures before the August recess.”

 “Republicans’ funding bill for the Agriculture Department and the FDA, in addition to the Financial Services spending bill, will not be considered on the floor as originally planned, according to three sources familiar with the whipping problems,” Emma and Scholtes reported. “Both measures failed to clear the floor last summer, thanks to politically unpalatable funding levels and conservative policy riders, including language blocking abortion and contraceptive protections. Those same issues are ensnaring GOP leaders yet again, despite an effort to dial back on some of the more controversial provisions that previously stymied floor passage.”

 Politico’s Meredith Lee Hill wrote on the social media platform X that the main reason the bill was pulled from a House floor vote was that “conservatives wanted an amendment vote to re-add the controversial abortion pill rider centrist Rs had stripped out.”

 “’I think that the major objections that often go for the reason it didn’t pass last year have been removed, so I don’t see a problem with it,’” (Rep.

 The proposed cotton label would allow application before, during, and immediately after planting. Over-the-top applications would also be allowed through the six-leaf growth stage but no later than July 30. 

 Because the application involves a new use pattern for dicamba, the EPA is providing a 30-day public comment period on the registration application consistent with the Federal Insecticide, Fungicide, and Rodenticide Act (FIFRA). The EPA also seeks comment on the associated draft labeling Syngenta submitted, which is available in the docket.

 The last day to submit a comment on the proposed registration and label is August 22. To read more about the registration application proposed by Syngenta and submit a comment, see docket

Natalina Sents Bausch," As drought continues to intensify in North Carolina, the corn crop is shriveling up. More than 90% of the state’s crop is in fair condition, or worse, according to USDA’s Crop Progress report published July 15.


 Jeremy Petree has been in the crop insurance business for 15 years. “There will be a lot of claims paid this year,” he says. A farmer of 40-plus years and client recently remarked, “It’s never been this bad.”


 Petree added, “I know there was some hope that the genetics of the corn crop would help it recover and surprise everyone, but I think it’s getting late enough that the corn crop is just not going to be there.”


 According to the most recent Crop Progress report, 44% of North Carolina corn is in very poor condition, 29% is poor, 18% is fair, 9% is good. There is no excellent corn in the state.


 Some farmers are attempting to salvage their corn crop by chopping it for silage, but that won’t be an option for everyone, says Petree. “There’s so much of it out there.”


 On Monday USDA said 85% of North Carolina’s corn is silking, 3 percentage points ahead of both the five-year average and last year at this time.


 The report noted 43% of the corn crop has reached the dough growth stage, significantly ahead of the 34% five-year average. Last year at this time 32% of North Carolina’s corn had achieved dough.


 Kevin Matthews is a fourth-generation farmer in East Bend, North Carolina. “Our early corn is very rough, and the mid plantings are fair with the later just begging for rain before it tassels.”


 He’s grateful for his irrigation, adding, “If a drip tape or sprinkler isn’t doing its job, the crop will show you quickly.”


 Other North Carolina crops are struggling in the dry conditions, too. USDA rated 7% of soybeans very poor, 24% poor, 43% fair, and 26% good. There are no excellent soybeans in North Carolina.


 Matthews says his soybean crop is holding on, but “the deer damage is horrendous. Wildlife are eating the crops faster than they can grow with such little moisture.”


 Cotton is struggling, too. USDA rated 7% of North Carolina’s cotton crop very poor, 14% poor, 39% fair, 44% good, and 5% excellent.


 North Carolina peanuts were rated 3% very poor, 9% poor, 38% fair, 46% good, and 4% excellent for the week ending July 14.


 Pasture and range conditions in the state were rated 12% very poor, 43% poor, 32% fair, and 13% good. There was no excellent pasture reported in North Carolina.


 Farmers are harvesting their second cutting of hay, but not as quickly as last year. USDA said 27% of second cutting was complete the week ending July 14. That’s well behind the five-year average of 38%.


 Drought has spread and intensified quickly over the last three months. At the beginning of April more than 88% of the state was free of drought stress.


 The most recent drought maps, published July 11, 2024, show 100% of the state is suffering from moisture stress. D3 extreme drought covers a portion of Columbus County in the southern tip of the state. More than 19% of North Carolina reported D2 severe drought conditions. Almost 68% of the state is in D1 moderate drought. Nearly 12% of North Carolina is abnormally dry.


 The Crop Progress report rated North Carolina topsoil moisture 15% very short, 34% short, 47% adequate, and 4% surplus. Subsoil moisture was rated 11% very short, 37% short, 51% adequate, and 1% surplus.


 Petree urges farmers with drought stricken crops to call their crop insurance agent promptly to get on their list. With such widespread losses in the state, “there’s a lot of corn that needs to be appraised,” he says.


 It is important to call your crop insurance agent before you start chopping or destroying anything. It needs to be appraised first. “If a crop is destroyed before someone’s had a chance to take a look at it, then there’s really not a lot anyone can do,” explains Petree.


 He adds, “Don’t be afraid to call your agent.” Crop insurance coverage is based on what production is actually harvested. “It’s not like car insurance where just turning something in and not getting any money out of it is going to increase your premium,” he says.

 For 3 years we have been pushing the planting date on ultra early soybeans. 2022 was a great success, 2023 was a flop. So going into 2024, I had already decided if it was unsuccessful the test would be abandoned. On July 22 we harvested 49 acres of soybeans. To date this will be the biggest success of all 3 years with a yield of 87 bushels per acre. The day before, I would have sold them to anyone for 70 bushel per acre.


 Seed size was the determining factor that pushed these little, short soybeans to a respectable yield. As the combines were whacking them out, the planter was putting in a second soybean crop hopefully to be harvested by mid-November. We also have one more field with a later maturity that was planted in February also so we can figure out how much maturities matter when planted that early.


 Since harvest we have had six full days of clouds and showers, which isn’t good for anything. Our next field will be desiccated hopefully Monday. We will keep you up to date on the following second crop soybeans as time goes on.


 


 It is unreal how fast things can change. A week ago I felt like many more acres would not be harvested, and yes the mental stress was at a level I’ve rarely seen. I really didn’t think some fields could take another hot dry day then Friday night a few rains fall gave some relief. More rain within a few days caused the drought to be over and the floods came after 4 to 7 inches of rain. My goodness how the crops have turned around. Some are ugly there is no doubt about that, but we’ve got something to harvest now that the soybeans are looking good. 


 The rain was perfect for the later planted corn. With the rain going into the late third and fourth quarter we have grain to protect and build weight into. The sprayers are running and the weeds have responded just like the corn and soybeans. Fungicides and foliar fertilizer are being applied.


 I got the opportunity to step away from the farm and attend AgPhD in South Dakota. It was a blast and I am thankful for everyone I got to meet and speak with. Our next big event is the XtremeAg Field Day on my farm featuring AgroLiquid, Nachurs, Pioneer Z series trials corn varieties plots and variety fertility responses. There will also be John Deere equipment and staff to get us ready for harvest.


 


 The rains have finally relieved some of the pressure from the area. Early April corn is too far gone to help at this point. Late May corn actually has a chance to make it. Later planted corn has pollinated now and should not be as bad as early planted corn. Pollination on early planted corn is really bad due to the drought and heat. 


 Early beans are at R4 and they look like they aborted a lot of pods during the dry and hot period. It is a below average crop but at least there is a crop. About 30% of double crop soybeans were planted over due to planting in dry conditions and there was just enough moisture to swell them and then they died. Once we had a few small rains the double crop beans have now come on and they look better at the moment, but they have a lot of catching up to do.

 Underground drainage tiling apparently failed and formed a sinkhole in a cornfield in northwest Iowa that allowed manure to flow into a creek, where it killed small fish for miles, according to the Iowa Department of Natural Resources.

 The manure came from Roorda Dairy, west of Paullina, which has about 4,200 dairy cattle, DNR records show. The dairy was irrigating a field with manure and didn’t notice the damaged tile line because of standing corn, said Tom Roos, a senior environmental specialist for the department.

 “With all these rain events, a tile line must have burst,” he said.

 Paullina is in O’Brien County in far northwest Iowa, parts of which have suffered severe flooding in recent weeks. The pressure from influxes of water into tile drains can cause weak areas to rupture, after which soil can flow into the tiling and create a sinkhole.

 On Wednesday, someone noticed dead fish in nearby Mud Creek and reported it to state law enforcement. A DNR investigation found that the manure had been flowing into the creek through the drainage tiling and killed fish along about nine miles of the stream, until it met another creek.

 It’s unclear how many gallons of manure might have spilled into the creek and how many fish it killed, Roos said. An investigation is ongoing.

 The dairy promptly plugged a culvert to prevent more manure from reaching the creek, Roos said. He did not know how long the spill had occurred.

 Roorda Dairy paid a $5,000 fine to the DNR in 2022 for starting construction on a manure digester without state approval. Digesters use bacteria to consume the manure and emit flammable gases, such as methane, that can be used to heat or power farm operations.

 It is officially summertime harvest mode! We started the winter wheat harvest at the beginning of the week. Yields have been really good. It’s a slow go, but nobody is complaining, with the yields being good. We are running our combine, plus our custom harvester is running five machines. We split up into four- and two-machine crews. They have several other crews running in the central part of the state, around Pierre and Onida.


 All of their crews have moved up into South Dakota. The next moves will be North Dakota and Montana. By the time we are finished, it will be time to clean and prep to load and head out to jobs farther north.

 The pace is nonstop. They’ve come a long way from their first harvest stops, in Texas and Oklahoma, and the harvest push will go well up into Canada. Our wheat has been the best they have cut so far this year. We are crawling along at 1.5-2 mph, but for a good reason. They joke they can count the lugs on their tires while cutting.


 We finished up some R1 passes on part of our soybean crop, trying new things to see how the results are. Last year a bone-dry August skewed the data. There was too much variation in the passes to see a definitive difference. Hopefully, this year August will be more favorable. We also just got done doing some corn acres via plane just before tassel. Temperatures have been nice so far for July: many days in the 80s, buying us time on our row crops. Nice growing days, not scorching heat. But we all know the heat is coming. We are more used to 100°F days cutting wheat than 85°F.


 We are finishing up hauling our last 40,000 bushels of 2023 corn. We are binning wheat, and also shipping from the field to two different terminals. Wheat goes in one direction, then rock for road construction heads back. We will be focused on getting the wheat crop harvested. There’s a long way to go yet, and moving 400,000 bushels of wheat to take the pressure off storing fall crops in the next 30 days. With decent weather the combines should be loaded up and headed north within two weeks, and trucks will keep on humming. Summertime never stops, and neither do we. Stay safe, everyone.


 


 The heat has arrived for a few days, and because of the rain that we've had, our crop looks really good. We haven’t even turned on the irrigation yet, but it appears to me that tomorrow we will turn it on in a couple spots for the first time. Our pastures are holding on okay. We're getting to that time of the year where the brome is going downhill, which is the reason that we are doing the research with the rotational grazing and the other species of plants.


 I have been somewhat disappointed in the growth of these other plants, but the reason for the disappointment, I believe, is the chemical carryover: the atrazine from last year’s corn crop and even the herbicide from the soybeans in 2022. I think all farmers need to be aware of the chemical safety of the following year’s crops relative to what chemicals we’re using. The dry weather that we’ve had in 2022 and 2023 has allowed those chemicals to remain in that soil profile longer. I think we’re seeing the results of that in the disappointing growth.


 We’re going to stay with this rotational grazing program. We believe next year will be better. We’re continuing to learn, and it’s been an eye-opening experience to watch.


 


 Let’s talk about the drought for a second. There are a lot of different variables with soybeans and corn in the South. It just depends on whether we got rain or not.


 We’ve been in this drought and heat for the last three weeks. We’ve received some rains, but they have not been widespread. There has been some rain here, then you might get rain there, and then you might not get rain for another five miles or so. It’s just really hit or miss.


 The planting date for corn this year is really important. A lot of our early-planted corn is going to make it, significantly more than our late-planted corn. This is something we’ve seen a lot in the South when we’re trying to beat the heat. This is our normal weather pattern — we get this heat but we usually catch a good rain around the Fourth of July. When we didn’t get that rain, it really put us in a hole for rainfall this year. So the corn is drying down at a considerable rate because it’s been so hot. Some of our corn will be decent, but some of it won’t be as good.


 The early soybeans are in the same boat as the corn. In some places we’re putting fungicide on, and moving ahead with the right program where we’ve got rains. It doesn’t take a lot of rain, just a half-inch here and a half-inch there. We’re moving ahead and putting fungicide on other soybeans.


 I don’t know if you sprayed them that they would take anything in. They’ve got the leaves turned over. They’re just in bad drought stress, and they’re actually changing colors and turning yellow — you can see through them. So we’re not going to spend any more money on those until the weather changes and we see the soybeans try to turn around.


 But the soybeans that have received rain have good potential. The irrigated soybeans have good potential, and we’ve been keeping the water going — that’s a whole other struggle. We’ve been running about a dozen pivots, and I’m telling you, everyone on the farm has had their work cut out for them to keep these things going. Anyone who has worked with pivots before knows exactly what I am talking about. We are going to keep trying our best and hopefully get some good yields out of what we have.

 National Weather Service maps forecast rain during the next seven days for parts of the region, including much of Iowa and Illinois, the largest U.S. corn and bean producers. Additionally, much of the eastern Corn Belt is projected to see rainfall during the next week. 

 Showers are expected to ease some dry areas in the western Midwest, and weather forecasts look wetter for parts of the eastern Midwest, Commodity Weather Group said in a note to clients.

 Precipitation will boost soybeans and cotton in the Delta, the forecaster said. 

 Sixty-eight percent of the U.S. soybean crop were in Good or Excellent condition last week, according to the USDA. Fifty-seven percent of the corn crop earned top ratings. 

 The USDA is scheduled to release its weekly crop progress report this afternoon. 

 The weather has been favorable in parts of the Midwest this growing season. Iowa is free of drought and abnormally dry conditions, according to the U.S. Drought Monitor. At the start of the year, 97% of Iowa were facing dry or drought conditions. 

 Only 2.3% of Illinois are seeing abnormally dry conditions vs. 12% at the start of the calendar year, the monitor said. 

 Soybean futures for November delivery fell 16½¢ to $10.32 a bushel overnight on the Chicago Board of Trade (CBOT). Soy meal lost $5 to $319.70 a short ton, and soy oil was down 0.31¢, to 41.52¢ a pound. 

 Corn futures for December delivery dropped 1½¢ to $4.08½ a bushel.

 Wheat futures for September delivery lost 3½¢ to $5.20 a bushel, while Kansas City futures gained 2¢ to $5.47½ a bushel. 

 Investors reduced their net-short positions, or bets on lower prices, in corn and beans in the seven days that ended July 23, according to data from the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC).

 Speculators held a short position of 333,885 futures contracts in corn, down from 352,772 contracts a week earlier, the government agency said. That’s the smallest bearish position since June 25. 

 Money managers were net-short by 172,945 soybean futures contracts last week, down from 183,145 contracts seven days prior, the CFTC said. 

 In wheat, hedge funds and other large investment firms held a net-short position of 73,159 in soft-red winter futures, up narrowly from 72,831 contracts. Speculators also held a net-41,016 hard-red winter contracts, down modestly from 44,624 contracts a week earlier, the agency said. 

 The CFTC’s weekly Commitment of Traders shows trader positions in futures markets. The report provides positions held by commercial traders, or those using futures to hedge their physical assets; noncommercial traders, or money managers (also called large speculators); and nonreportables, or small speculators.

 A net-long position indicates more traders are betting on higher prices, while a net-short position means more are betting futures to decline.

 Extremely hot weather is expected for a large chunk of the Corn Belt. Red flag and excessive heat warnings have been issued from the Texas panhandle east into southern Indiana, National Weather Service maps show. 

 The eastern half of Kansas is under an excessive heat warning; indexes in some counties are forecast to reach 111°F, the agency said. Areas of eastern Missouri and western Illinois are predicted to see heat indexes of 114°F this afternoon.

 Seventy-four percent of U.S. spring wheat was in good or excellent condition as of Sunday, down from 77% a week earlier, the agency said. That’s still well above the 42% that earned top ratings at the same point last year. 

 One percent of the crop was harvested at the beginning of the week, USDA said. 

 Last week’s three-day tour of North Dakota’s spring wheat fields showed a favorable outlook for the crop. 

 The Wheat Quality Council’s annual tour of the state showed projected yields of 54.5 bushels an acre, up from last year’s forecast for 47.4 bushels, U.S. Wheat Associates said. Durum yields are projected at 45.3 bushels an acre, up from 43.9 bushels a year earlier. 

 “After three days of analyzing, counting and calculating, participants came to a common conclusion: North Dakota wheat farmers may have produced their best crop in decades,” US Wheat said.

 North American sales dropped 16% to $837.8 million and South American sales plunged 42% to $348.9 million. Sales in Europe and the Middle East (EME) lost 4.4% to $1.9 billion, and Asia Pacific sales declined 34% to $157 million. 

 In the first six months of 2024, total sales lost 14% to $6.18 billion, AGCO said. North American sales dropped 18% to $1.57 billion, South American sales were down 41% to $652.3 million, EME sales fell 1.7% to $3.63 billion and Asian sales dropped 26% to $323.7 million.

 “Softer industry sales, lower end-market demand and de-stocking efforts all contributed to lower sales [in the North American market],” the company said. “The most significant sales declines occurred in the hay equipment, mid-range, and high-horsepower tractor categories.”

 AGCO on July 25 agreed to sell most of its grain and protein business to American Industrial Partners (AIP) for about $700 million in cash.

Chuck Abbott," Nine farmworkers at two egg farms in Colorado have contracted mild cases of bird flu since mid-July while killing and disposing of millions of infected chickens, said public health officials on Thursday. “These preliminary results again underscore the risk of exposure to infected animals,” said the 
 (CDC), which added that the risk to the general population remains low.

 The 
 said that approximately 118 people have been tested for the avian flu virus and 10 cases have been confirmed — nine on poultry farms since July 12 and one on a dairy farm in May. The national total, which includes three workers on dairy farms in Michigan and Texas, is 13 since April. In addition, a Colorado correctional inmate was infected with the H5N1 virus while culling an infected chicken flock in 2022.

 All of the infected poultry workers were employed on egg farms in Weld County, northeast of Boulder — six on one farm and three on the other. The CDC and the Colorado Department of Public Health jointly announced confirmation of the outbreak among workers on the second farm.

 “The three confirmed cases occurred in people who were working directly with infected poultry at a commercial egg layer operation that had reported an outbreak of H5 bird flu among poultry,” said the CDC. “All three people have mild illness and have been offered the antiviral drug oseltamivir for treatment. State and local officials continue to monitor poultry workers on farms with infected poultry.”

 According to the CDC, “The risk to the general public from H5N1 [avian flu virus] remains low.” Genetic tests show that the virus has not changed in ways that would make it more communicable, it said, and there have been no signs of unexpected increases in flu activity in Colorado or the rest of the country.

 Highly pathogenic avian influenza has killed nearly 101 million birds in domestic flocks in 48 states since the disease appeared in the United States in February 2022. Some 172 dairy herds in 13 states have been diagnosed with H5N1 infections since late March. Fifty of them are in Colorado.

 For weeks, the CDC has said people working with infected or potentially infected livestock should wear protective gear. For jobs like culling infected flocks, workers should wear water-resistant coveralls, masks, goggles, gloves, and boots, it says. Officials have acknowledged that it is difficult to assure compliance during prolonged physical labor in hot weather.

 “Historically, most human cases of bird flu infection have happened in people who are not wearing recommended personal protective equipment,” said the CDC. Investigators will ask about the use of protective equipment on the Colorado farms, it said.

 “Dozens of wheat traders, millers and bakers fanned out across the state in an annual crop tour this week,” Hirtzer reported. “They found lush wheat fields — thick with tall, green plants. Farmers enjoyed a speedy spring sowing season and ample rainfall in May and June, before a recent turn to hot and dry weather.”

 “The primary variety grown in the state of hard red spring wheat should yield 54.5 bushels per acre, according to the tour’s final data Thursday,” Hirtzer reported. “That’s up 15% from last year and just below the US Department of Agriculture’s projection earlier this month of 56 bushels per acre — the highest ever. The tour estimate would also mean the state’s highest yield ever.”

 “Larger production for Hard Red Winter (HRW) and Hard Red Spring (HRS) are the major factors driving the year-to-year increase in total wheat production, while smaller increases are seen for White and Durum. Soft Red Winter (SRW) is down from the previous year’s bumper crop,” Sowell wrote. “Stronger U.S. supplies this year are expected to make U.S. wheat more competitive on the global market, contributing to higher exports. Total U.S. exports are forecast at 825 million bushels, the largest since 2020/21.”

 
 that “the Wheat Quality Council’s Hard Winter Wheat Tour concluded Thursday, May 16, in Manhattan, Kansas. After three days, scouting 449 fields across the state and some into neighboring Nebraska and Oklahoma, the total weighted average yield for hard winter wheat was estimated at 46.5 bushels per acre (bpa), a 55% increase from 2023.”

 “Last year, the average yield estimate for the 2023 winter wheat tour was 30.0 bpa,” Jenkins reported. “Based on May 1 conditions, Kansas’s 2024 winter wheat crop is forecast at 268 million bushels, up 33% from last year’s crop, according to USDA National Agricultural Statistics Service.

 “Still, prices for foods made from the staple grain are still relatively expensive.

Chuck Abbott," After three years of study, the 
 proposed limits on salmonella contamination of raw chicken and turkey products on Monday with an emphasis on the types of salmonella bacteria mostly likely to cause illness. Consumer groups said the proposal, modeled on a 1994 USDA ban on the most dangerous types of E. coli bacteria in ground beef, was a large step forward for public health.

 “The proposal is one of the greatest advances in food safety in a generation,” said the 
. The 
 said the USDA proposal “sets safety standards where they matter to consumers; on poultry products themselves rather than on the establishments that process the birds.” The current safety system calls for processors to implement plans to avoid the contamination of poultry meat in the plant but allows sale of products containing salmonella.

 Contaminated food is the number one cause of salmonella infections in the United States, and poultry is one of the leading sources of food-borne salmonella illnesses. Although the presence of salmonella bacteria in poultry products has been declining, there has been no reduction in salmonella illnesses, said the USDA. It estimates there are 125,000 cases of salmonella illnesses related to chicken and nearly 43,000 illnesses related to turkey annually.

 “This proposed framework is a systemic approach to addressing salmonella contamination at poultry slaughter and processing, which includes enforceable standards that will result in safer food for consumers and fewer illnesses,” said Agriculture Secretary Tom Vilsack. “Far too many consumers become sick from poultry contaminated with salmonella, and today’s announcement marks a historic step forward to combat this threat.”

 Under the USDA proposal, raw whole chickens, chicken parts, ground chicken, and ground turkey products would be barred from sale if they contain 10 or more colony forming units per gram of salmonella bacteria and any amount of three disease-causing salmonella serotypes apiece for chicken and turkey.

 Poultry processors also would be required to develop a microbial monitoring program to prevent pathogen contamination during slaughter.

 Trade groups for the broiler chicken and turkey industries questioned the scientific basis for the USDA regulation and warned it might drive up costs.

 “We support changes in food safety regulations that are based on sound science, robust data, and are demonstrated to positively impact public health. We are concerned this proposal is not based on any of those,” said Ashley Peterson, in charge of regulatory affairs at the National Chicken Council, a trade group. “It also has the potential to significantly raise the price of chicken at a time when Americans are dealing with inflation in every part of their lives.”

 The 
 said USDA’s meat safety agency, the Food Safety and Inspection Service, already had the power “to drive improvements in food safety without implementing a final product standard for salmonella in turkey products.”

 In April, the USDA issued a regulation, with a one-year grace period, that would reject raw chicken as an ingredient in 
 if it contained too much salmonella. It was the first USDA rule to name salmonella as an adulterant in a class of raw poultry products.

 Americans are forecast to consume 117.1 pounds of chicken and turkey meat per person this year, slightly more than the amount of red meats they are forecasted to consume, which includes 58.2 pounds of beef and 51 pounds of pork.

 In the 1800s, the Fond du Lac Band of Lake Superior Chippewa joined other tribes in signing a pair of treaties with the federal government, giving up massive swaths of land in return for the creation of a reservation in eastern Minnesota. The treaties included a guarantee: Tribal members would be able to return in perpetuity to the lands they were signing away to gather wild rice, known as manoomin.

 “There’s a recognition that [manoomin] is a relative that figures very prominently in the Ojibwe migration story,” said Nancy Schuldt, water projects coordinator with the environmental program for the Fond du Lac Band of Lake Superior Chippewa. “It is one of the hallmarks of the how and the why [that] the Ojibwe people found themselves migrating to the western Great Lakes.”

 Retaining the right to harvest manoomin allowed tribal members to maintain a connection to their ancestral lands, even as they were forced to live within reservation boundaries. But wild rice is very sensitive to environmental conditions, and the tribe found that sulfate pollution from nearby mining threatened the waters on which their harvest depended.

 The tribe fought for decades to get the state of Minnesota to issue water quality standards to protect wild rice and, later, to enforce those standards. But Wisconsin, where the Fond du Lac Band also retains harvesting rights in certain areas, has been much slower to enact similar protections.

 Tribal leaders are hopeful that a new federal rule will change that.

 This May, the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency issued a revision to the Clean Water Act that requires states to consider tribal treaty rights when crafting water quality regulations. The rule could protect resources such as wild rice, sturgeon, salmon and shellfish.

 While many tribes have issued pollution standards for waters within their own boundaries, the federal rule will cover off-reservation landscapes on which Native people still exercise hard-won rights to hunt, fish and gather. Such areas cover millions of acres mapped out in dozens of treaties, concentrated especially in the Great Lakes and Pacific Northwest.

 State regulators have long been tasked with setting water quality standards for those areas. Now, the new rule directs them to consider the treaty-protected aquatic species that depend on those waters. For instance, states may be forced to lower pollution thresholds in some waters to account for the fact that tribal members who practice subsistence lifestyles consume fish at higher rates than the general public.

 Daniel Cordalis, an attorney with the Native American Rights Fund, a tribal advocacy group, said tribes have long been frustrated with some state regulators for setting regulations without tribal input.

 “Tribes have been asking for this for a long time,” he said. “These are federally based rights that need to be incorporated into the calculus as you’re developing or revising a water quality standard.”

 In Washington state, a landmark court decision in 1974 forced the state to recognize tribal fishing rights, and entitled tribal members to half of the harvestable catch. Officials with the Washington State Department of Ecology say they have a formal process for reaching out to tribal governments whenever they propose a new rule.

 In 2009, agency leaders began a dialogue with tribes over the state’s human health criteria. The agency had long relied on baseline federal figures — meaning pollution limits were set on an assumption that residents eat 6.5 grams of fish per day.

 After discussions with tribal groups, however, officials determined that the baseline figure was too low to protect tribal members whose diets are heavy in salmon and other culturally important aquatic species. Higher consumption rates made tribal members vulnerable to accumulations of mercury and other contaminants that fish can pick up in polluted water.

 “We knew it needed to be updated and be reflective of fish consumption that was really happening in Washington state by tribes,” said Melissa Gildersleeve, who oversees water quality standards for the agency. “We’ve gotten used to that conversation around tribal data.”

 In 2016, Washington state issued new criteria based on a consumption rate of 175 grams per day, nearly 30 times the previous assumption. Because of tribes’ right to harvest fish, waters throughout the state gained extra protections in order to ensure that right could be exercised safely.

 But other states have been more resistant, with a dozen joining a lawsuit seeking to get the new EPA rule thrown out. They argue that it treads on states’ delegated authority to set standards under the conditions laid out in the Clean Water Act, putting tribal interests before states’ judgment. The lawsuit also asserts that treaty rights are guarantees made by the federal government, and putting the onus on states to validate and uphold those rights gives them a near-impossible task.

 “This starkly conflicts with the [Clean Water Act’s] specific recognition, preservation, and protection of the States’ primary right and responsibility to establish designated uses and consequent water quality standards,” the plaintiffs wrote.

 The states challenging the rule are Alaska, Idaho, Iowa, Louisiana, Montana, Nebraska, North Dakota, South Carolina, South Dakota, Texas, Utah and Wyoming.

 Tribal leaders say that Idaho and other states in the case have long ignored tribes’ attempts to have their rights considered. They say the rule is necessary because states have demonstrated that they won’t listen to tribes unless they’re forced to.

 “Historically, it’s taken litigation to get states to recognize tribes’ rights, and that’s really expensive,” said Gussie Lord, managing attorney of the Tribal Partnerships Program with Earthjustice, an environmental law group. “This provides a framework for a process that has been divisive and adversarial.”

 Some other tribal advocates believe the rule, if upheld, could represent a massive shift. They note that pollution isn’t the only factor preventing the exercise of their rights. In some areas, irrigation for agriculture or the construction of dams have reduced water flows in rivers and choked off fish populations.

 “This could be one tool in restoring the flows back into these waterways,” said Ken Norton, chair of the National Tribal Water Council, a tribal advocacy group.

 The states opposing the rule fear the same outcome, arguing that it would conflict with states’ authority to delegate water rights.

 The rule could also require states to set higher standards even in waters where treaty rights aren’t currently being exercised. If tribes aren’t harvesting fish in a river because it’s polluted, states must consider what the harvest might look like if poor water quality didn’t prevent tribes from exercising their right.

 The EPA did not grant an interview request to discuss the rule and its implications.

Mariah Squire," According to USDA’s most recent Crop Progress report, all of the country’s top corn-producing states now have at least some percentage of corn that has reached the dough stage. Five of those states are ahead of their respective five-year averages by at least 10 percentage points and up to 21 percentage points. 


 According to USDA, 62% of Missouri’s corn crop had reached the dough stage the week ending July 28. Last year at this time, only 51% of the crop was at the dough stage. What’s more, the five-year average is 41% – that’s 21 percentage points lower than the current percentage of dough-stage corn. 


 In terms of good-to-excellent corn, 78% of Missouri’s corn falls in this category, ranking second of top-producing states (behind Pennsylvania). The state also ranked second for the most corn rated excellent (behind Nebraska). Overall, Missouri’s corn rated 4% very poor, 4% poor, 14% fair, 58% good, and 20% excellent.


 Favorable weather and soil moisture levels undoubtedly played a role in the progress and condition of Missouri’s corn. According to USDA, the average temperature statewide was 76.5°F, which was 1°F below normal, and soil moisture levels were mostly adequate. USDA rated topsoil moisture supply 1% very short, 10% short, 84% adequate, and 5% surplus and subsoil moisture supply 0% very short, 6% short, 92% percent adequate, and 2% surplus.


 USDA said that 37% of Nebraska’s corn crop had reached the dough stage the week ending July 28. That’s a jump of 19 percentage points and 17 percentage points compared to last year at this time and the five-year average, respectively.


 At 27%, Nebraska had the most corn rated excellent of the country’s top producers. The breakdown of condition ratings by USDA for the state is as follows: 3% very poor, 7% poor, 16% fair, 47% good, and 27% excellent.


 Travis Gustafson, an Agronomic Service Representative for Syngenta Crop Protection covering central and western Nebraska, described sustained high temperatures that are not taking as much of a toll on crops as they could. He explained the following for the week ending July 28: “Average highs were in the 90’s with this pattern forecasted to continue for the next seven to 10 days. While it is hot, it is not unprecedented for this time of year. The early season rains we had in Nebraska helped to build the subsoil moisture profile back up from the drought conditions we had last year and the crop does not seem to be showing signs of stress despite the high temperatures.”


 In the Buckeye State, 25% of the corn crop had reached the dough stage, USDA said Monday. That’s quite a surge compared to a five-year average of 9%, and even more striking compared to the percentage of corn at the dough stage last year at this time: only 2%.


 Ohio’s corn was rated by USDA as follows: 1% very poor, 4% poor, 29% fair, 55% good, and 11% excellent.


 Despite great progress and condition numbers, Ohio’s recent weather is causing some concern. The most recent U.S. Drought Monitor report showed that nearly 70% of the state was abnormally dry or worse as of July 23. State Statistician Ben Torrance said that the dry conditions were beginning to worry farmers; that’s according to the USDA NASS Ohio Crop Weather report released July 29. 


 As of July 28, 48% of the corn crop in Kansas had reached the dough stage. That’s 16 percentage points ahead of the five-year average. It’s also an increase of 18 percentage points since the week prior and 13 percentage points compared to last year at this time.


 As for corn conditions, only about half of Kansas’ corn was in good or excellent shape as of July 28. USDA rated 5% of the state’s corn very poor, 12% poor, 31% fair, 40% good, and 12% excellent.


 According to USDA, 34% of Iowa’s corn crop had reached the dough stage as of July 28. Although that’s only 2 percentage points up from where the state’s crop was last year at this time, it’s 10 percentage points ahead of the five-year average. 


 Iowa’s corn is largely in good shape, with only 4% rating very poor or poor. The specific condition breakdown for the state is as follows: 1% very poor, 3% poor, 19% fair, 58% good, and 19% excellent.

FERN's Ag Insider," Lucrative tax credits of up to $1.25 a gallon should be available only for low-carbon fuels made from U.S.-grown feedstocks, 
 told the Biden administration on Wednesday. In a letter, the groups also said the government should broaden its list of climate-smart farming practices that produce lower-carbon “sustainable” crops.

 The letter was aimed at 45Z tax credits, which are to become available in 2025, for sustainable aviation fuel (SAF). The administration has yet to issue regulations for the credits. In April, it published a 
 for SAF produced from 2022-24. Under the guidance, only a fraction of U.S. biofuels would qualify for the 40B credits. The Biden administration has a goal of increasing SAF production to 3 billion gallons by 2030.

 “However, without clear domestic feedstock requirements, the benefits of this policy are at risk of being diverted from American farmers,” said the letter. “The 45Z tax credit has the potential to be a game-changer for our industry.”

 The 40B guidelines lack a domestic feedstock requirement, said the letter, and they are too rigid in saying that jet fuel produced from ethanol must come from corn grown on farms that used no-till, planted cover crops following harvest, and applied enhanced-efficiency fertilizer or be made from biomass-based diesel derived from soybeans grown on farms that used no-till and cover crops. “Additional options from compliance must be considered,” the groups said.

 The letter was signed by the American Farm Bureau Federation, the National Farmers Union, the National Corn Growers Association, and the American Soybean Association.

 Separately, fertilizer maker CF Industries and ethanol maker POET announced a 
 in the western Corn Belt that would use low-carbon ammonia fertilizer to grow corn for ethanol production. The practice “can reduce the carbon intensity of ethanol up to 10 percent,” said the companies. The test would begin this fall and continue through the 2025 harvest.

Chuck Abbott," The EPA will have to take a new look at requests for three dozen “hardship” exemptions from the ethanol mandate under a ruling by the U.S appeals court in Washington. Ethanol makers, “extremely disappointed” by the ruling, said they were considering a response, “which may include seeking further review of today’s decision.”

 At issue was EPA’s denial in April 2022 of 36 requests by small refiners for a waiver from the Renewable Fuel Standard requirement to blend biofuels into gasoline for cars and pickup trucks. At the time, the EPA said the refineries did not face disproportionate economic harm if they had to buy credits, known as RINs, to make up for their failure to mix enough ethanol into gasoline.

 The appellate court vacated the denials on Friday and ordered the cases remanded to the EPA for further proceedings. The court opinion was sealed from public view so the its reasoning and specific instruction to EPA were not known. In April, judges on the appeals court questioned whether the EPA was overly strict in determining if a refiner faced financial hardship in complying with the RFS, reported 
.

 “EPA’s decision in 2022 to deny the petitions was well-reasoned, based on sound economic analysis, and consistent with the Clean Air Act and the objectives of the Renewable Fuel Standard,” said 
—the American Coalition for Ethanol, Growth Energy, and the Renewable Fuels Association. “We will evaluate our next steps, which may include seeking further review of today’s decision. Our coalition remains resolute and committed to protecting and defending the proper implementation of the RFS.”

 During the Trump era, the EPA issued dozens of waivers from the RFS. Biofuel advocates said the exemptions amounted to a 1.4-billion-gallon reduction in ethanol demand at a time when the RFS generally set a target of blending 15 billion gallons a year of corn ethanol into motor fuel. When it took office, the Biden administration indicated it would be more stringent in evaluating requests for exemptions.

 Involved in the EPA’s decision in 2022 were exemptions granted by Trump officials for RFS obligations in 2018. The 36 exemptions were part of a Supreme Court ruling in 2021 on EPA discretion to issue RFS waivers. Based on that ruling, an appeals court told the EPA to decide by April 7, 2022, on whether or grant or deny them. The 
 and said it would create an alternative method of compliance for 31 refiners that did not require them to buy or retire RINs.

 In addition to remanding the exemptions to the EPA, the appellate court also dismissed a lawsuit challenging the EPA alternate method of compliance.

 In his acceptance speech at the Republican National Convention late last week, former President Donald Trump made no direct mention of agriculture. But he touched on a number of issues — electric vehicles, clean energy, and trade — that directly affect the agriculture industry.

 “Trump started the rambling 1½-hour speech on a unifying note and by recounting, for the first time in public, how he escaped assassination on Saturday in Butler, Pennsylvania,” 
 late last week. “… But Trump eventually pivoted into long riffs on his priority issues, including trade, energy, and immigration.”

 Trump made perhaps his strongest remarks when it came to electric vehicles, with 
 that “former President Donald Trump used his nomination speech to take aim at President Joe Biden’s electric vehicle policies, vowing to action against them on his first day in office.”

 “ ‘I will end the electric vehicle mandate on day one,’ Trump said in his address at the Republican National Convention in Milwaukee. The move would result in ‘saving the U.S. auto industry from complete obliteration, which is happening right now, and saving U.S. customers thousands and thousands of dollars per car,’ he said,” Natter reported. “While the Biden administration doesn’t have a mandate on electric vehicles, critics of new air pollution limits issued by the Environmental Protection Agency in March have said they would illegally force automakers to sell EVs.”

 
 late last week that “corn growers and ethanol producers fear the emission standards will depress demand for ethanol-blended gasoline, although it’s not clear how much and how fast the reduction in demand would be. At the same time, the biofuel industry is looking to preserve tax incentives created by the IRA to subsidize production of sustainable aviation fuel.”

 Natter reported that “Trump’s remarks on EVs came just moments before he criticized what he said was trillions of dollars of wasteful spending ‘having to do with the green new scam.’ He said he would instead direct the money to projects like roads, bridges and dams, though it wasn’t immediately clear how he would make good on the pledge.”

 Brasher reported that the “green new scam” “was an apparent reference to the Inflation Reduction Act enacted in 2022. The IRA, which included funding for farm bill conservation programs, was estimated to cost well under $1 trillion. But Trump promised to somehow redirect clean energy funding to infrastructure projects. ‘We will not allow it to be spent on Green New Scam ideas,’ Trump said,” according to Brasher’s reporting.

 
 that “Trump didn’t directly talk about his pledge to impose across-the-board tariffs on imported products and duties of up to 60% on China. But he promised to bring more auto manufacturing to the United States, threatening to impose tariffs of 100% to 200% on foreign-made autos. ‘They will be unsellable in the United States,’ he said.”

 “He also touted his administration’s trade record,” Brasher reported. “ ‘We have long been taken advantage of by other countries, and think of it, oftentimes these other countries are considered so-called allies,’ Trump said. ‘We lose jobs, we lose revenue, and they gain everything, and wipe out our businesses, wipe out our people. I stopped it for four years, I stopped it.’ ”

 “He also mentioned the U.S.-Mexico-Canada trade agreement that replaced the North American Free Trade Agreement, which Trump called the ‘worst trade deal ever made,’ ” Brasher reported.

 Trump’s comments on trade followed a speech from his pick for vice president, Sen. J.D. Vance of Ohio, who “blames increased trade with China, Mexico and other low-wage countries for job losses that have devastated manufacturing communities in the industrial Rust Belt, including his home state of Ohio,”

 Tens of thousands of farmers or would-be farmers who say they suffered discrimination when they applied for assistance from the U.S. Department of Agriculture will get one-time payments that total about $2 billion from the federal government.

 “While this financial assistance is not compensation for anyone’s losses or pain endured, it is an acknowledgement,” U.S. Agriculture Secretary Tom Vilsack said Wednesday in a call with reporters.

 The payments are the result of a program — the Discrimination Financial Assistance Program — created by the Inflation Reduction Act of 2022 that was meant to aid farmers, ranchers and forest landowners. President Joe Biden said it was the result of his promise “to address this inequity when I became president.”

 The USDA received more than 58,000 applications from people who claimed discrimination based on race, color, national origin, sex, sexual orientation, gender identity, religion, age, marital status, disability and retaliation for “civil rights activity.”

 Vilsack could not immediately say what type of discrimination was most often indicated by the applicants, but the bulk of the payments went to farmers in southern states with higher percentages of Black residents.

 Payments 
 to people in every state and three of its territories, but residents of Alabama and Mississippi alone received almost half of the money. There were 30 people in Iowa who are set to receive a total of about $4 million.

 More than 43,000 people will be paid, Vilsack said. The payments range from $3,500 to $500,000, depending on the circumstances and effects of the discrimination.

 The department could not immediately supply a summary of those claims, but Vilsack said the discrimination resulted in loan denials, loan delays, higher interest rates and an overall lack of assistance.

 “We’ve made significant strides in breaking down barriers to access, and my hope is that people will begin to think differently about USDA, so that we can better serve all who want to participate in agriculture in the future,” Vilsack said.

 Specifically, Vilsack said the department’s Farm Service Agency, which administers farm loans, now has a more diverse leadership and loan assessment processes that rely less on human discretion.

 Federal health officials are encouraging farm workers who tend livestock and poultry to get vaccinated for seasonal influenza to help prevent a bird flu mutation that might spark a pandemic in people.

 The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention said Tuesday it would devote up to $5 million to pay for the vaccinations, and that it will rely on states to implement the initiative.

 There are 14 known human infections of highly pathogenic avian influenza that resulted from contact with infected dairy cattle and poultry in the United States, and all but one has happened in the past four months.

 The virus has been circulated by wild birds for more than two years and has sporadically transmitted to domestic birds. A variation of the virus has been infecting U.S. dairy cattle since December, and four people who worked closely with infected cattle also became ill.

 In recent weeks, nine people in Colorado who were tasked with culling infected poultry contracted the virus.

 The CDC has maintained that the virus’ risk to humans is low — those who have been infected so far had minor symptoms of respiratory illness or pinkeye, or both.

 It has not been shown to transmit between people, but the virus has the potential to rapidly gain that ability if it infects someone who also has a seasonal flu virus.

 “Such dual infections, while rare, could potentially result in an exchange of genetic material between two different influenza viruses,” Nirav Shah, principal deputy director for the CDC, said in a call with reporters Tuesday.

 Shah said that “reassortment” process could pose a “significant public health concern” if bird flu gains the ability to spread person-to-person the way seasonal flu does, potentially resulting in a virus that spreads easily and causes severe symptoms.

 Shah said the CDC will devote up to $10 million for farm workers’ health related to avian flu. Half will be spent educating and training farm workers about how to avoid being infected.

 The other half will pay for seasonal flu vaccines for an estimated 200,000 farm workers who tend livestock and poultry. The CDC hopes to vaccinate all of them but acknowledges that less than half of the general population typically gets a flu shot.

 How the voluntary vaccination effort will proceed is unclear. State health officials are expected to implement them, most immediately in the 13 states that have confirmed infections among cows.

 That includes Iowa, where 13 dairy herds have been infected. However, no new infections have been reported in the state in the past month.

 A spokesperson for the Iowa Department of Health and Human Services — which presumably would coordinate with the CDC — did not immediately respond to a request to comment for this article.

 The vaccine will not protect the workers from contracting bird flu, Shah said, nor will it guarantee they won’t be infected by seasonal flu. But he said it’s an important component of the public health response to the new virus’ threat.

 “The risk here is a theoretical but important risk,” Shah said.

 The confirmations of new bird flu infections among cattle have waned significantly in most states, except for in Colorado. In the past 30 days, two-thirds of the nation’s 32 newly infected herds were in that state, according to U.S. Department of Agriculture data.

 Some of that might be due to Colorado’s 
, but it’s also “a quirk of history and geography,” said Eric Deeble, deputy under secretary for marketing and regulatory programs for the USDA.

 The state has far fewer dairy farms than the leading milk-producing states, but most of them are concentrated in one county.

 “They are all in very close proximity to one another, and so there is a lot of sharing of equipment, a lot of sharing of personnel and a lot of movement on and off farms to adjacent farms,” Deeble said.

 The USDA has identified the movement of equipment and people between dairy farms as a primary vector for virus transmissions from herd to herd and from herd to flock.

 The virus has been identified in 172 dairy herds in the United States this year. Fifty of them are in Colorado. In Texas, where the infections originated, the virus was confirmed in 22 herds, although there were many that went untested because they recovered before bird flu 
 as the culprit.

, was confirmed sick on Friday. On Saturday, officials identified another presumptive positive case in a worker at a separate poultry farm in Weld County.

 The cluster of cases, comprising eight people in Colorado, accounts for most of the bird flu cases in humans in the country.

 Thirteen counties in Colorado have at least one poultry flock with a bird flu outbreak, according to the 
. Weld County has 12 affected flocks, accounting for over 9 million birds. There have also been 28 cattle herds with confirmed cases in Colorado, 
.

 The Colorado Department of Public Health and Environment says it is safe to eat properly handled and cooked poultry products, as the proper handling and cooking of meat and eggs kills viruses. The risk of bird flu to the general public is low and there has not been evidence of the virus spreading from person to person.

 A lopsided vote on the U.S. Senate Energy and Natural Resources Committee advanced a bipartisan bill Wednesday to overhaul the process to gain federal approvals for energy projects.

 The 15-4 vote demonstrated broad support for 
, though it remains unclear if Congress will take the time in an election year to move the measure to President Joe Biden’s desk.

 Members of both parties have complained that the process of gaining permits from federal agencies for energy projects is overly complicated and lengthy, delaying clean energy and fossil fuel production alike. The bill, sponsored by West Virginia independent Joe Manchin III and Wyoming Republican John Barrasso, aims to streamline the federal permitting process.

 The bill would also require lease sales for oil and gas production in the Gulf of Mexico and lift a controversial 
 on certain liquefied natural gas exports that Biden put in place in January.

 At Wednesday’s committee meeting, Manchin, who chairs the panel, said only a bipartisan effort could effectively cure the problems with energy permitting. The bill was the product of nearly two years of negotiation that included input from a wide range of interested parties, he said.

 “We’ve listened to everyone,” Manchin said. “And I think we’ve hit it right in the middle.”

 Democrats Ron Wyden of Oregon and Mazie Hirono of Hawaii, as well as independent Bernie Sanders of Vermont, who caucuses with Democrats, voted against the measure. Republican Sen. Josh Hawley of Missouri also voted no.

 Sen. Martin Heinrich of New Mexico, who is in line to be the next top Democrat on the committee after Manchin — formerly a Democrat — retires in January, supported the bill, which could give the package momentum in the next Congress if it stalls this year.

 Heinrich said that while certain provisions would increase carbon dioxide emissions, the bill’s benefits outweigh the harms.

 “This was a carefully crafted, bipartisan, balanced bill,” he said after the vote. “All of us have things we love about it. We also have a few things that we’re not crazy about, but that’s how legislation works.”

 Republican Sen. Lisa Murkowski of Alaska sounded similar notes, saying the bill lacked some elements she wanted, but was overall a positive step.

 “I think it’s important that we demonstrate some forward movement on permitting reform,” she said. “And while this isn’t the end-all and be-all, as we’ve all acknowledged, it starts moving us forward.”

 While most Democrats on the committee supported the bill, some opposed the measure based on provisions that would benefit the fossil fuel industry. Some environmental advocates also raised that objection.

 “It’s disappointing so many senators have been duped into voting for another sweetheart deal for the fossil fuel industry in exchange for meager improvements on electricity transmission,” Brett Hartl, government affairs director at the environmental group Center for Biological Diversity, wrote in a statement.

 Wyden said he supported several parts of the bill, but could not support the entire package. The bill would counteract the 2022 law Democrats passed that offered hundreds of millions of dollars in tax credits for clean energy, Wyden said.

 Wyden praised provisions to overhaul mining standards, ease permitting for transmission lines and address geothermal energy. If the bill contained only those provisions, Wyden said he would support it and “recommend a parade down Main Street.

 “Unfortunately, there are a number of provisions in this bill that run contrary to what I think the effort in 2022 was all about, the transformative efforts,” he said.

 Wyden called for continued efforts to rework the bill before it receives a vote on the Senate floor. Other members, including those who voted to approve the bill, also called for continued tweaks.

 Murkowski, a former chair of the committee, said she was disappointed the bill did not include more on hydroelectric energy.

 Manchin told Murkowski he would continue to work with her on hydro provisions.

 Members of both parties introduced a series of amendments Wednesday. Republicans largely sought additional requirements to produce fossil fuels. Democrats sought restrictions on fossil fuel production.

 Manchin led opposition to all the amendments introduced Wednesday, saying they would throw off the bill’s careful bipartisan balance.

 “I believe that we’ve identified a reasonable compromise with our bill,” he said.

Mariah Squire," According to USDA, Ohio corn progress is far ahead of historical averages, and two thirds of the crop is in good/excellent condition, but dry weather is worrying farmers.


 The percentage of corn at the silking stage in the Buckeye State jumped significantly since the last Crop Progress report and was also far ahead of historical averages. As of July 28, 81% of the state’s corn crop had reached the silking stage, an increase of 21 percentage points since the week prior. Last year at this time, only 54% of the state’s corn was at the silking stage. Further, the five-year average is just 60%.


 A quarter of Ohio’s corn had reached the dough stage as of July 28. With 25% of the corn crop at the dough stage, that’s a jump of 12 percentage points compared to the week prior. Last year at this time, just 2% of the state’s corn had reached the dough stage, and the five-year average for Ohio is only 9%. 


 As far as corn condition, two-thirds of Ohio’s corn crop was in good shape or better, and only 5% was rated very poor or poor the week ending July 28. The specific breakdown of corn conditions was 1% very poor, 4% poor, 29% fair, 55% good, and 11% excellent.

 Despite great numbers for corn progress and condition, weather conditions in Ohio are causing some concern. State Statistician Ben Torrance of the USDA NASS Ohio Field Office said that dry conditions were beginning to worry farmers. That’s according to the Ohio Crop Weather report released July 29. 


 The most recent U.S. Drought Monitor report showed that over 72% of the state was abnormally dry or worse as of July 30. Further, nearly 40% of the state was experiencing at least moderate drought conditions, and almost 14% of the state was experiencing severe drought conditions.


 Pickaway County is one of the areas experiencing the worst of the drought conditions. According to the U.S. Drought Monitor, over 99% of the county was in a severe drought as of the week ending July 30, and it’s been that way since the week ending July 16. What’s more, the whole county has seen at least moderate drought conditions since the week ending July 2.


 Brenna Gibson, who farms alongside her husband H.L. in Pickaway County, shared that they don’t expect the bumper crop they had last year by any means. “This year is extremely dry. Last year was a great crop year.”


 The particular area Gibson’s farm is located is a particularly dry area in the first place, she said. Even crops just a bit north or south of them are greener than their own. “When [we] farm, it’s almost like a gamble because we don’t have those timely rains like some areas do,” Gibson said.


 In 40 years of farming together, this isn’t the first time the Gibsons have faced growing seasons that are more challenging than the norm. “We’ve gone through this before, and we’ve weathered the storm before … we’ll get through it,” she said. Ultimately, Gibson’s attitude is to “hope for the best always” and she expressed a hopeful dependence on God to provide, saying, “He always does, even in the lacking times.”

Iowa Capital Dispatch," 


 All parts of Iowa — for the first time in more than four years — have sufficient soil moisture to not be considered “abnormally dry” by national climate experts, according to a U.S. Drought Monitor report on Thursday.

 That dryness designation can indicate an area is on the cusp of drought conditions, under which affected areas can have negative impacts for agriculture and water supplies.

 An example: After years of drought, a lake that supplies water for the city of Osceola had lost so much of its volume that the city considered 
. Significant rainfall in recent months has restored the lake to nearly its normal surface elevation, according to city data.

 Drought developed in Iowa in July 2020 and persisted 
, after the state had one of its wettest starts to a year on record. It marked a dramatic recovery since September, when the state was the driest it had been in a decade.

 Last week, Iowa had rainfall that was below average, according to State Climatologist Justin Glisan. However, heavy rain fell along the eastern edge of the state, where the last remaining pocket of abnormal dryness lay.

 A month ago, about 31% of the state was abnormally dry, according to Drought Monitor reports. The last time there was no drought or dryness was May 2020.

 The federal Climate Prediction Center does not foresee drought re-emerging in Iowa in the coming months. Iowa lies in the center of a multistate area that has no drought and little abnormal dryness.

 The USDA reported this week that more than 90% of Iowa’s farm fields have adequate or surplus moisture for growing crops. Last year, only 57% of topsoil was rated the same way.

 Soaring temperatures made it difficult for farm workers to protect themselves from chickens recently infected by avian influenza in Colorado and likely contributed to five people contracting the virus, according to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.

 State health officials 
 last week — the largest cluster of human infections in the country since the bird flu outbreak began more than two years ago.

 Human infections are 
 to public health officials because they increase the likelihood that the virus could mutate to easily pass from person to person and spur a human pandemic. A total of 10 infections among people have been discovered since April 2022.

 But the virus found in the Colorado workers does not possess such a mutation, said Dr. Nirav Shah, principal deputy director for the CDC, in a Tuesday call with reporters. It’s believed they were each infected by egg-laying chickens as they sought to cull a flock of about 1.8 million in the northeast part of the state.

 It is customary to kill entire flocks when they are infected by highly pathogenic avian influenza — which readily infects and kills poultry — to prevent its spread to other flocks.

 The Colorado workers grabbed the chickens, placed them into containers that can hold dozens at a time, and asphyxiated them with carbon dioxide, said Dr. Julie Gauthier, executive director for field operations for the U.S. Department of Agriculture’s Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service.

 The workers typically wear suits, goggles, gloves, and boots, and they breathe through respirators that protect them from pathogens.

 But the outdoor temperature at the time of the work was about 100°, and the temperature inside the facility was likely hotter. Giant fans moved air to cool the inside, which circulated potentially virus-laden debris such as feathers.

 “The difficulty with wearing all that gear in that kind of heat, you can imagine,” Gauthier said, “and it was made more difficult by those fans pushing the air — made it hard to keep those goggles and N95 respirators in place.”

 The virus that infected the flock is similar to one that has infected dairy cattle in 13 states, Shah said. Colorado has had the most infected herds of any state, with at least 37. It’s possible that the virus was transported to the egg-laying flock from one of those herds, Shah said.

 Highly pathogenic avian influenza has been spread by wild birds and has been sporadically devastating for U.S. poultry flocks since January 2022. About 99 million birds in infected flocks have been destroyed, according to CDC data.

 Federal officials believe the virus passed from wild birds 
 in December. Since then it has spread to herds in other states, likely due to the transportation of infected cattle. From there it is believed to have spread locally to other herds and poultry flocks via people and their equipment, including farm workers and veterinarians.

 Colorado accounts for seven of the 10 known human infections in the United States that were the result of interactions with sick birds and cows. It had the first-ever infection of a poultry worker, in April 2022. Early this month, a Colorado dairy worker was also infected.

 The workers who were recently infected had mild symptoms of pink eye and respiratory illness.

Noah Rohlfing," At the end of May, Tennessee crops and soil were faring well, after a wet spring season. However, June and July have been different. Rapid-onset drought has hit much of central and eastern Tennessee, as high temperatures collided with a stop to regular rainfall. 

 According to data from the Iowa Environmental Mesonet, June 1–July 23, areas of central Tennessee experienced upwards of 5 inches less precipitation than the yearly average. 

 In the latest Drought Monitor report released July 25, 48.3% of the state is in D1 moderate drought or worse — a jump of 47 percentage points from April. Corn crop condition has also worsened; the most recent USDA Crop Progress report indicates that as of July 21, 51% of the state’s corn are in Good/Excellent condition — down from 56% the week prior.

 Soybeans are in 58% Good/Excellent condition — down from 62% the week prior.

 Tennessee Assistant State Climatologist William Tollefson said the sudden uptick in drought has been difficult on corn and pastures. 

 “The grasses were all brown, trees were showing signs of stress,” Tollefson says. “We got reports of cattle issues, like pastures, having to feed hay and bring in water. Some farmers were selling calves to reduce stress on their pastures.” 

 Corn was the other concern. “In certain counties, the drought hit right as tasseling was starting,” Tollefson says. “They were starting to silk. We had a report from one extension agent that the silks were turning black immediately because it was so hot and dry.”

 Hay has been impacted heavily. State Climatologist Andrew Joyner says there have been reports of calves being sold off in numbers above the yearly average due to a lack of viable hay. In Smith County, east of Nashville, he says, a reported 1,214 head were sold as of July 13 — a near-doubling of the 802 head sold in July 2023. 

 Pasture conditions in the latest Crop Progress report were only 24% Good/Excellent, with 42% of pastures rated as Poor/Very Poor. 

 Difficulties in the livestock and crops have left much of Tennessee wishing for consistent rains. 

 The National Weather Service Climate Prediction Center’s short-term forecast for the end of July and beginning of August expects above-average precipitation for Tennessee. The August monthly prediction indicates the same. Temperatures are forecast to continue to be high.

 “It seems like our pattern is shifting,” Joyner says.

 Tollefson and Joyner say Tennessee would need immense precipitation to emerge from drought conditions. Steady rainfall for for multiple days per week over a long period would be preferable to intense rainfall. That would help pastures and fields recover to pre-drought conditions.

 In the long term, Joyner says farmers are hoping for tropical moisture to come through in August, September, and October — which didn’t happen in 2023. 

 “Usually, they’re pretty helpful for us,” Joyner says. “Last year we didn’t have any. We are really hoping for some tropical moisture later into the fall to help during the end of the growing season and toward harvest season.”

 GARDEN CITY, Kan. — Western Kansas is hopping this summer, as the number of grasshoppers spikes.

 Kansas State University Research and Extension Entomologist Anthony Zukoff said wet weather patterns this spring are supporting the presence of large grasshopper populations across western and central portions of the state.

 Zukoff said hot, dry summers increase the likelihood of young grasshoppers, or nymphs, surviving to adulthood. More adult grasshoppers mean increased egg production during cooler months. If the following spring is warm and wet, more eggs hatch, and more nymphs can survive.

 “So, several years of hot, dry summers followed by warm, wet springs can eventually lead to large populations of grasshoppers in some regions,” Zukoff said.

 Ag producers in western Kansas will have lessened chances for rainfall over the next several days. The extended outlook from meteorologists at the National Weather Service office in Dodge City calls for thunderstorm chances to taper off, and temperatures to remain around 90°F through the end of the month.

 K-State Assistant State Climatologist Matt Sittel said the hottest point of the summer has passed, with five days in July registering above 100°F across much of the state.

 Sittel said July 15 was the hottest day so far this year in Kansas, with an average high temperature across the Kansas Mesonet weather observation system of 102°F. At least 30 Mesonet sites reached 100°F each day July 12–15. The hottest temperature reading of the year for Kansas came on July 13, when Webster Dam in Rooks County recorded a high of 111°F.

 Sittel said the probabilities stretching into August favor above-normal temperatures and near-normal chances of precipitation for most of the state.

 Zukoff said the extra rainfall in early spring has helped spur leafy plant growth, including broadleaf weeds, which grasshoppers thrive in. Ag producers should be aware of higher-than-normal grasshopper numbers, but most crops should be mature enough to withstand some defoliation from grasshoppers eating them, according to Zukoff.

 He said five to eight grasshoppers per square yard in corn or sorghum fields may be enough to warrant insecticide treatment.

 “Later this season, fall-planted crops could be at risk, especially as alternate food sources are controlled or go dormant,” Zukoff said.

 If an ag producer planting alfalfa finds 15 or more grasshoppers per square yard around the planting area, Zukoff recommends treating the area before planting.

 For wheat, the vegetated borders around the planting areas should be scouted at least 10 days before planting, Zukoff said, with treatment recommended if there are seven to 12 grasshoppers per square yard.

 Zukoff said three or more grasshoppers per square yard within a wheat field can destroy seedling wheat stands. Seed treatments can protect emerging wheat plants for several weeks, as long as the grasshopper population remains low.

 A heat wave that gripped much of the Midwest has moved on and rain is forecast for much of the region in the next six to 10 days, according to the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration. 

 Rain will be near normal for eastern Nebraska and much of western Iowa during that timeframe, while there's an above-average chance for precipitation in eastern Kansas, much of Missouri, eastern Iowa and the northern two-thirds of Illinois, NOAA said. 

 Soybean futures for November delivery rose 3 1/4¢ to $10.46 1/4 a bushel overnight on the Chicago Board of Trade. Soymeal added $1.20 to $312.70 a short ton and soy oil was up 0.24¢ to 44.57¢ a pound. 

 Corn futures for December delivery gained 2 1/2¢ to $4.07 1/2 a bushel.

 Wheat futures for September delivery rose 4 3/4¢ to $5.40 a bushel, while Kansas City futures added 3 1/4¢ to $5.66 a bushel. 

 Sales of corn to overseas buyers declined in the week through July 11 while wheat and bean sales rose, according to the Ag Department. 

 Corn sales for delivery in the 2023-2024 marketing year that ends on Aug. 31 totaled 437,800 metric tons, the agency said. That's down 19% from the previous week and 10% from the prior four-week average. 

 Japan purchased 191,200 metric tons, Mexico bought 129,400 tons, Colombia was in for 102,000 tons, Saudi Arabia took 60,000 tons and Portugal purchased 55,000 tons. 

 The total would've been higher but an unnamed country canceled orders for 195,100 tons and Costa Rica nixed cargoes of 10,800 tons. 

 Sales for the 2024-2025 year that starts on Sept. 1 were reported at 485,700 tons. Exports for the week jumped 26% to 1.1 million tons. 

 Soybean sales rose 10% week to week to 228,100 metric tons, USDA said. That's still down 29% from the average. 

 Egypt was the big buyer at 92,000 tons, followed by Japan at 35,200 tons, South Korea at 25,900 tons and Indonesia at 18,600 tons, the government said. 

 For the 2024-2025 marketing year, sales were reported at 507,000 tons. Exports last week dropped 25% to 200,800 tons, USDA said. 

 Wheat sales jumped to 578,500 metric tons, more than double the previous week and up 1% from the average, the department said. 

 South Korea took 119,000 tons, Mexico purchased 92,700 tons, China was in for 72,300 tons, Indonesia bought 70,000 tons and Italy purchased 61,000 tons of U.S. wheat. An unnamed country canceled shipments of 92,500 tons. 

 Exports for the week surged to 630,900 tons from 294,600 tons the previous week, USDA said in its report. 

 Thunderstorms are moving their way through the southern Plains this morning and will continue later this afternoon, according to the National Weather Service. 

 Some of the storms could bring damaging winds to the area, the agency said in a report early this morning. Storms are expected to continue from tomorrow through Wednesday. 

 Scattered thunderstorms are also forecast today for parts of central South Dakota, NWS said. 

 Severe weather will be isolated today, and there's a daily chance of storms through the weekend, the agency said. 

 Flooding is expected to continue on the Mississippi River along the Illinois-Missouri border. 

 The river at Hannibal, Missouri, was at 21.6 feet late Thursday, well above flood stage of 17 feet. The Mississippi is expected to recede to 20.7 feet by Monday morning, NWS said.

Tony Dreibus," Soybean and grain futures surged in overnight trading on technical buying and amid some global weather concerns.

 Futures may be oversold, leading investors to liquidate their net-short positions, or bets on lower prices, and buy back futures contracts. 

 Giving prices a boost overnight are signs of demand for U.S. agricultural products. 

 Exporters sold 105,000 metric tons of soy meal for delivery in the 2024–2025 marketing year to an unidentified country, the USDA said in a report last week. 

 The USDA also said exporters sold 510,000 metric tons of soybeans to unidentified destinations to be delivered in the next marketing year. A separate sale of 150,000 metric tons of soy meal was also announced. 

 Commodity Weather Group said in a note to clients that parts of Saskatchewan and Alberta, both large wheat- and canola-growing provinces in Canada, may slip drier and are at risk for crop losses. 

 Still, ample rain has fallen in parts of the U.S. Corn Belt — too much in some areas, as flooding is ongoing — that has kept crops hydrated. 

 Soybean futures for November delivery jumped 19½¢ to $10.55½ a bushel overnight on the Chicago Board of Trade (CBOT). Soymeal added $6.20 to $313.70 a short ton, and soy oil was up 0.57¢ to 44.54¢ a pound. 

 Corn futures for December delivery gained 6½¢ to $4.11¼ a bushel.

 Wheat futures for September delivery rose 4¢ to $5.46¾ a bushel, while Kansas City futures added 1¾¢ to $5.71¾ a bushel. 

 Investors reduced their net-short positions, or bets on lower prices, in corn futures in the seven days that ended July 16, according to the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC).

 Speculators held a net 352,772 futures contracts in corn, down from 356,415 contracts a week earlier, the agency said. 

 Money managers raised their bearish bets on soybean futures to 183,145 futures contracts, CFTC said. That’s up from 162,803 contracts the week prior. 

 In wheat, investors were more bearish week to week. 

 Hedge fund managers and other large investment firms held 72,831 futures contracts in soft red winter wheat, up from 68,692 contracts seven days earlier. 

 Investors held 44,624 hard red winter wheat contracts, up from 40,893 contracts the previous week, CFTC said in its report. 

 The weekly Commitment of Traders report from the CFTC shows trader positions in futures markets.

 The report provides positions held by commercial traders, or those using futures to hedge their physical assets; noncommercial traders, or money managers (also called large speculators); and nonreportables, or small speculators.

 A net-long position indicates more traders are betting on higher prices, while a net-short position means more are betting futures will decline.

 Isolated thunderstorms are expected in parts of eastern North Dakota and western Minnesota this afternoon, according to the National Weather Service (NWS). 

 Small hail and gusty winds are forecast for the area, the agency said. 

 Storms also are expected in parts of northern South Dakota that could produce heavy rainfall and small hail, NWS said. Some of those storms could linger through the evening into the early overnight hours. 

 In central Kansas, meanwhile, some isolated storms are forecast, though severe weather isn’t expected, NWS said.

Noah Rohlfing," June was an all-time wet month for Minnesota farmers. 

 According to the 
, June 2024 was the fourth-wettest June on record in the state and the fifth-wettest month in recorded Minnesota history. The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) reported the average June rainfall throughout the state was 6.78 inches. 

 Kenny Blumenfeld, senior climatologist for Minnesota, said a stretch in the middle of the month contributed heavily to the large rainfall totals.

 “In addition to a persistent, active pattern, we got stuck in an eight-day pattern where it just rained really, really hard,” Blumenfeld said.

 The impact of the consistent heavy precipitation has been stark, with flooding happening throughout the state. A 
 said nearly half of Minnesota was in flooding conditions because of high water levels on the Missouri, Minnesota, and Mississippi rivers. Blumenfeld said that even before heavy June rains, there were reports of flooding in agricultural areas that resulted in equipment being submerged in some fields.

 In the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) Crop Progress report released on July 8, Minnesota only had 2.9 days suitable for fieldwork during the first week of July. 
 said, “Heavy rain and saturated soils continue to restrict access to fields throughout much of the state. Some livestock losses were reported due to flash flooding.”

 Blumenfeld said there has been difficulties for farmers with the sheer amount of rainfall and subsequent floods. 

 “I took a drive because I was giving a talk to an ag group in June during the wet spell,” Blumenfeld said. “I lost count after I got to 15 different flooded farm fields on a stretch two hours west of the Twin Cities.

 “Not every producer, not every farmer in the state, but certainly quite a few in southern Minnesota have had some difficulties because of very wet fields. Even if they have tile drainage, it was too wet for the tiles to shed effectively.”

 USDA’s most recent Crop Progress report said Minnesota was up to 4.7 workable field days as of July 14. Corn and soybean conditions have been steady, with 58% of corn in good/excellent condition and 58% of soybeans in good/excellent condition. 

 Corn silking is at 16%, 8 percentage points behind the five-year average of 24%. Soybeans are also blooming slower than the five year average of 51%, with progress at 46% as of July 14.

 Data from the Iowa Environmental Mesonet from June 1 to June 30 shows a higher surplus of precipitation in the western half of Minnesota. The hardest hit area, according to the map, was the southern tip of Minnesota, where areas experienced upwards of 10 inches more rainfall than the average.

 Blumenthal said farmers in the state are weary of returning to drought-like conditions like those in 2023, and are hesitant for rain to stop completely. 

 But, he said, a return to “stability” would be welcome for the rest of the summer. 

 The July outlook from the National Weather Service‘s Climate Prediction Center (CPC) has Minnesota still more likely to receive more precipitation than the yearly average and neither high nor low temperatures. This is in stark contrast to most of the Corn Belt, which has experienced multiple large-scale heat waves already through the first half of the month.

 Long-term forecasts and predictions from the CPC actually have Minnesota as likely to experience above-average temperatures through the July-August-September period. Precipitation outlooks put the state as middle of the road with no clear indications of dry or wet conditions.

 The Colorado Department of Agriculture will now require regular testing of dairy milk as the highly pathogenic H5N1 avian influenza — bird flu — continues to spread throughout the state. 

 Commercial cow dairy farms licensed by the Colorado Department of Public Health and Environment that are not already under a bird flu-related quarantine will undergo weekly testing of bulk samples. This will include facilities with dairy cattle used to produce milk, butter, pasteurized and other cheeses, frozen desserts, ice cream, dry milk, condensed milk and cottage cheese, among other products for human consumption. 

 The state issued 
 on Monday.

 “We have been navigating this challenging, novel outbreak of (bird flu) in dairy operations for nearly three months in Colorado and have not been able to curb the spread of disease at this point,” Dr. Maggie Baldwin, the Colorado state veterinarian, said in a statement. “We have seen devastating impacts of this disease not only to our dairy industry, but our poultry industry as well. With the strong support of the dairy and poultry industries, we feel that this is the best next step in order to protect these vital industries in our state.”

 In the last 30 days, 30 cattle herds in Colorado have been affected by the virus, according to the 
. According to the 
, 39 flocks in Colorado have had a bird flu outbreak, including both poultry and non-poultry. 
 in Colorado have contracted the virus, the most of any other state in the country. Seven of those people work on poultry farms, while one works on a dairy farm.

 Under the mandate, samples collected from farms will be tested at the Colorado State University Veterinary Diagnostic Laboratory, and any farm whose dairy produces a non-negative test result for H5N1 will be placed under quarantine. 

 The order mandating testing does not have a set expiration date, so state agricultural leaders or the state veterinarian must issue another order to cease testing. Any farms that fail to comply with the requirements of the order will be referred to the Colorado attorney general’s office.

 “We appreciate the ongoing cooperation and partnership with both the poultry and dairy industries,” Colorado Commissioner of Agriculture Kate Greenberg said in a statement. “Mandatory surveillance of highly pathogenic avian influenza across all of Colorado’s Grade A commercial dairies is a critical next step to tamping down the virus and protecting the food system. Ongoing cooperation is key to supporting workers’ health and safety, protecting animal health and welfare, and minimizing the spread of the virus.”

 CDPHE says it is safe to eat properly handled and cooked poultry products, as the proper handling and cooking of meat and eggs kills viruses. The risk of bird flu to the general public is low and there has not been evidence of the virus spreading from person to person.

 that “production capacity of sustainable aviation fuel in the United States could jump by 1400% in 2024 if all announced capacity additions come on line, the U.S. Energy Information Administration said on Wednesday.”

 “The EIA anticipates domestic production of (other) biofuels will increase by about 50% in 2024, led by rising SAF production,” Reuters reported. “…The EIA projects that SAF output will rise from 2,000 (barrels per day) to nearly 30,000 bpd in 2024.”

 Other biofuels, according to the EIA, includes sustainable aviation fuel (SAF), renewable heating oil, renewable naphtha, renewable propane, renewable gasoline, and other emerging biofuels that are in various stages of development and commercialization.

 
 that “Phillips 66’s Rodeo facility in California reached its renewable fuel production target of 50,000 bpd in June, of which 10,000 bpd is SAF. Valero’s Diamond Green project, in partnership with Darling Ingredients, at its Port Arthur, Texas refinery is expected to come online in the fourth quarter of this year and produce 15,000 bpd of SAF by the end of 2024.”

 “Investments in SAF have increased due to the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency’s Renewable Fuel Standard (RFS), federal tax credits, and state programs and tax credits incentivizing use of the fuel,” 
. “The White House also set a goal of meeting 100% of U.S. aviation fuel demand with SAF by 2050. About 1.6 million b/d of petroleum jet fuel was consumed in the United States in 2023, and we project U.S. jet fuel demand in 2050 to exceed 2.0 million b/d in our 2023 Annual Energy Outlook.”

 
 “that its projections for a tripling of Sustainable Aviation Fuels (SAF) production in 2024 to 1.9 billion liters (1.5 million tonnes) are on track. This would account for 0.53% of aviation’s fuel need in 2024.”

 “Renewable fuel production is shared by many industries and SAF is a part of renewable fuel production. That is why increasing the production of renewable fuel is key to increasing the potential of SAF,” the IATA said. “Some 140 renewable fuel projects with the capability to produce SAF have been announced to be in production by 2030. If all of these proceed to production as announced, total renewable fuel production capacity could reach 51 million tonnes by 2030, with production capacity spread across almost all regions.”

 “In December 2023 IATA reported that some 69 million tonnes of renewable fuel capacity were expected to be available by 2028. The most recent estimate is for 51 million tonnes of renewable fuel capacity to be available in 2030, based on currently announced projects,” 
. “Several factors have resulted in this reduced estimate. Most significant was an evaluation of projects against more stringent criteria for success and for the potential to meet SAF’s exacting sustainability criteria. Additionally, some projects have progressed at a slower pace towards commercial operations. With the right incentives, the potential for international aviation to reach a 5% reduction in carbon emissions by 2030 through SAF remains, provided policies are in place to increase the share of renewable fuel production allocated to SAF.”

FERN's Ag Insider," California and Wisconsin still dominate U.S. milk production, accounting for one-third of total output, but the dairy industry went through a substantial restructuring in the past 20 years, said USDA analysts. There were 26,290 dairy herds licensed to sell milk in 2023, compared to 70,375 herds in 2003; and milk production of 226.4 billion pounds last year was 33% larger than the 170.3 billion pounds two decades earlier.

 Texas and Idaho expanded production to become two of the five largest dairy states during that period, each with 7% of U.S. production. Meanwhile, California’s share of production dipped to 18%, a decline of 3 percentage points. Wisconsin produces 14% of U.S. milk today, up 1 point from 2002.

 There are fewer dairy cows nationwide but they each produce more milk, and very large dairy farms, with more than 2,000 head, are the source of 39% of the milk supply. Dairy farms tend to be larger in the West.

 “Not only have dairy farms become larger, but they have become more specialized in dairy production, lowering their production of other farm commodities and depending more heavily on purchased rather than homegrown feeds,” said the Economic Research Service report. “Larger dairy farms have tended to be more specialized in dairy production than smaller dairy farms and are the greater adopters of the most advanced technologies, management practices, and production systems.”

 filed the lawsuit a year ago, soon after the Supreme Court ruled that a similar California law was constitutional, and said it offered a new avenue to challenge the constitutionality of such laws.

 “The court now, after careful consideration, determines that the (Massachusetts) Act is not preempted by the FMIA (Federal Meat Inspection Act), and therefore grants the commonwealth’s motion for summary judgment…and denies the pork producers’ motion for summary judgment,” ruled Young in a 19-page decision. “Judgment shall enter for the commonwealth.”

 The meat inspection law governs the operations of slaughterhouses and does not extend to state laws on meat marketing, contrary to Triumph Foods’ interpretation, wrote Young. Triumph and the farmers who are its member-owners are not obliged to ship whole pork cuts to Massachusetts, said the judge, who noted that Triumph segregates its products for sale as organic, grass-fed, and other specialty categories.

 Known as Question 3, the Massachusetts law was approved in a landslide in a 2016 statewide referendum. California’s Proposition 12 was approved in a statewide referendum in 2018 and took full effect at the start of this year, after the Supreme Court decision and a phase-in period for the food industry.

 Current levels of futures contracts suggest that appropriate budgeting prices for 2024 crops production are $4.00 per bushel for corn and $10.50 per bushel for soybeans.

 Those prices would result in low returns in 2024, far lower than the last low-price period from 2014 to 2019. Much higher costs cause lower 2024 returns. Those budget price forecasts could change with unforeseen events, as does occur in agriculture. Over the next several months, estimates for returns and incomes will solidify. Still, it seems prudent to plan for much lower prices.

 Expectations generally have been for much lower corn and soybeans prices in 2024 compared with the 2021 to 2023. In February, the projected price used to set guarantees on crop insurance was set at $4.66 per bushel for corn. The projected price is the average of February settlement prices of the December corn traded on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange (CME) and represents an unbiased indicator of prices at harvest. The $4.66 projected price is well below the $5.90 projected price for 2022 and $5.91 for 2023.

 Since February, the December CME futures contract has fallen, currently trading near $4.10 per bushel (see Figure 1). This decline in price is consistent with a growing belief that yields in the U.S. will be above trend. Moreover, no significant market surprises have occurred that would either reduce supply or increase demand. In other words, a good supply of corn and roughly stable demand are leading to lowered price expectations.

 The current December futures price for corn is consistent with cash prices below $4.00 at harvest, roughly $3.80 per bushel. Given usual price patterns, one expects cash prices to increase over the marketing season, and an average cash price of $4.00 per bushel for 2024 production seems reasonable.

 A $4.00 price is well below recent prices. USDA reports the national market year average (MYA) price at $6.00 for 2021 and $6.54 for 2022. The 2023 marketing year will end in August, with a current forecast of $4.65 per bushel. If a $4.00 price occurs for 2024, it would be the lowest since 2019, when the market year average price was $3.56 per bushel.

 Futures markets are currently suggesting roughly similar prices for 2025 for corn. The December 2025 futures contract is trading near $4.60, indicating that cash corn prices at harvest in 2025 could be in the low $4.30 range.

 A similar story exists for soybeans. The 2024 projected price for soybeans is $11.55 per bushel, well below projected prices in 2022 ($14.33) and 2023 ($13.76). November futures prices have fallen since February, now trading near $10.20 per bushel. Cash price at harvest below $10 per bushel are likely, with an overall 2024 MYA price of $10.50 being an appropriate projection. Futures prices suggest continuing low prices into 2025, with a $10.80 price being an appropriate projection for the 2025 MYA price.

 Current markets are pointing to corn prices averaging near $4.00 per bushel and soybeans prices averaging near $10.50 per bushel over the next several years. Overall, the higher prices from 2021 through 2023 appear transitory, and prices are now moving to lower levels (see 
, 
). We may be again entering a period of lower prices like that from 2014 through 2019. From 2014 to 2019, central Illinois farmers received an average price of $3.64 per bushel for corn and $9.69 for soybeans.

 Current market price indicators of $4.00 per bushel for corn and $10.50 for soybeans are above the 2014 to 2019 averages. Still, return levels likely will be much lower than from 2014 to 2019 because of higher costs. According to Illinois Farm Business Farm Management (FBFM) data, non-land costs for corn averaged $587 per acre from 2014 to 2019 (see Revenue and Costs for Illinois Grain Corps 
). Those non-land costs increased to a projected $772 per acre, an increase of $185 per acre. Non-land costs for soybeans increased from an average of $363 per acre in 2014 to 2019 to a projected $512 per acre in 2024, an increase of $149 per acre. Cash rents increased from an average of $277 per acre from 2014 to 2019 to a projected $359 per acre in 2024, an increase of $82 per acre.

 We revised prices and yields in the central Illinois high-productivity budgets (see 
, 
) to reflect lower prices, higher yields, and some Price Loss Coverage (PLC) and Agriculture Risk Coverage (ARC) payments. Corn prices were lowered from $4.50 per bushel to $4.00 per bushel (see Table 1). Growing conditions have been good across Illinois, leading to an increase in yield from 227 bushels per acre to 234 bushels per acre. Soybean prices are reduced from $11.30 per bushel to $10.50 per bushel, while yields are increased from 72 bushels per acre to 75 bushels per acre. Also included are $5 of PLC/ARC payments. If those payments occur, they will be received in October 2025. Based on current crop conditions, crop insurance payments likely will be minimal in 2024. We also added $5 per acre to reflect modest crop insurance payments. On revenue products, lower prices likely will be offset by higher yields.

 Those changes cause farmer returns from cash rent farmland to decrease. For corn, farmer return decreases from -$100 per acre to -$185 per acre. Soybean returns decrease from -$57 per acre to -$74 per acre. Most of central Illinois is in a 50% corn and 50% soybean rotation, leading to an overall net farmer return of -$129 per acre on cash rented land.

 A -$129 per acre return would be the lowest since comparable records began in 2000. Over the entire 2000 to 2023 period, farmland returns averaged $90 per acre, but there is a great deal of variability across years. High return periods occurred

 Negative returns occurred after both high-price periods. Returns were -$3 in 2013 and -$10 in 2015. The 2014 projected returns are more negative at -$129 per acre.

 Some unanticipated events could increase prices, as happens in agriculture. As a reminder of possibilities, corn prices were approaching $3.00 per bushel in the summer of 2020, the beginning of the COVID pandemic. Then, a Derecho storm hit central Iowa in August, extending into northern Illinois, taking the top end off of U.S. yields. It also became evident that the China swine herd was being rebuilt after being severely impacted by African Swine Fever. Those two events began a period of higher prices, which were further fueled by the Ukraine-Russia conflict and lackluster yields across the world. Something similar could happen in late 2024, but those events are difficult to anticipate and seem unlikely.

 The federal government could institute an ad hoc disaster assistance program. A continuation of the Economic Relief Program (ERP) seems likely, given its prevalence in recent years (see 
, 
). Essentially, ERP offers a top-up of the coverage level of crop insurance. However, those programs likely will not fill the gap. Like crop insurance, ERP protects against within-year declines in revenue. One of the income issues now is the decline in price over the years. For example, the projected cost for corn fell from $5.91 to $4.66. An extension of the ERP program will do nothing to cover this $1.25 fall in price. An alternative ad hoc disaster assistance program could arise. It is, after all, an election year.

 Budgeting for $4.00 corn and $10.50 soybean prices seems appropriate for 2024. Slightly higher price expectations – $4.30 for corn and $10.80 for soybeans – are accurate estimates of market-driven estimates for 2025. Using these prices will result in negative returns for most cash-rented farms. Depending on a farm’s debt position, owned farmland could still provide positive cash flows. Returns and farm income will come into clearer focus in the next several months.

 Most farm operations have strong financial positions, with relatively low debt and high working capital (see 
, 
, 
, 
, and 
). However, the low returns that are expected will quickly erode that position, particularly the working capital position. Some farms may need to make changes to their operations to avoid severe losses of liquidity.

 The price and return outlook suggest downward adjustments in cash rental rates. However, cash rents typically have lags in moving downward when prices fall. Still, the severity of income declines may dictate that cash rents will come down for specific tracts, particularly it the farms operating those tracts currently have lower working capital levels.

 Some have suggested that farming is a boom to bust business. Long periods of low incomes like those from 2014 to 2019 need to be survived to gain financial resources from higher price and income periods like those in 2021 and 2022. We may have now entered another extended period of low prices again. Time will tell.

Tony Dreibus," Soybean futures were modestly lower in overnight trading, and grains were little changed, as investors focused on favorable weather in the U.S. Corn Belt. 

 Precipitation was expected in much of the Midwest this week, favoring parts of Minnesota, Wisconsin, and Illinois, said Don Keeney, an agricultural meteorologist with Maxar. 

 Rain is forecast for parts of the east-central Midwest today and southeastern areas Thursday, he said. 

 “Rains in southeastern areas will further improve moisture for corn and soybeans,” Keeney said. “Rain in central areas next week will maintain moisture.”

 Sixty-eight percent of U.S. soybeans were in Good or Excellent condition as of Sunday, unchanged week to week, the USDA said. Still, that’s well ahead of the 54% that earned top ratings a year earlier. 

 Twenty-nine percent of the crop were setting pods, up from 18% seven days earlier, and 65% were in bloom stage versus 51% the previous week, the USDA said. 

 Corn ratings fell to 67% Good or Excellent at the start of the week, from 68% seven days earlier, the agency said. Seventeen percent of the crop were in the dough stage, up from 8% last week, and 61% were in the silk stage, well above 41% the week prior.

 Wheat was mixed, as investors weighed improvements in Australian crop prospects against a dismal outlook in France, the European Union’s biggest producer of the grain. 

 Rainfall in southeastern New South Wales and southwestern Western Australia likely will boost prospects for wheat in the Australian states, Keeney said. 

 Moisture is expected to remain at a deficit in parts of western France, Hungary, and southern Italy, he said. 

 Soybean futures for November delivery fell 4¢ to $10.71½ a bushel overnight on the Chicago Board of Trade. Soymeal lost 30¢ to $318.80 a short ton, and soy oil was down 0.45¢ to 44.68¢ a pound. 

 Corn futures for December delivery rose ¾¢ to $4.18 a bushel.

 Wheat futures for September delivery gained 2¢ to $5.44¾ a bushel, while Kansas City futures lost ½¢ to $5.66¼ a bushel. 

 U.S. egg production in June fell 2% year-over-year to 8.81 billion, the USDA said in a report. 

 The total included 7.56 billion table eggs and 1.25 billion hatching eggs, composed of 1.15 billion broilers and 96.7 million egg types, the USDA said. 

 Egg layers totaled 371 million in June, down 3% from the previous year, while production per 100 layers rose 1% to 2,377. 

 In June, broiler hatchings, which are intended for meat production, totaled 833 million, a narrow year-over-year gain. Egg type hatchings — those that lay eggs — came in at 56.7 million, a 3% decline. 

 Broiler types in incubators were reported at 736 million on July 1. Egg types in incubators rose 8% to 53.6 million, the USDA said in its report. 

 Extremely hot weather is expected in western counties in North Dakota and South Dakota, according to the National Weather Service. 

 Heat indexes are forecast at around 103°F this afternoon, NWS said in a report early this morning. 

 In western Montana, values are expected to reach as high as 110°F. 

 “Extreme heat will significantly increase the potential for heat related illnesses, particularly for those working or participating in outdoor activities,” the agency said.

 Temperatures overnight will not drop as low as normal, falling only into the low 70s.

Mariah Squire," Brook Duer is a staff attorney at the Penn State Center for Agricultural and Shale Law. Starting in private practice in Lancaster County and representing clients in agriculture, he made his way to the Pennsylvania Department of Agriculture, where he was chief counsel for most of his tenure.


 Duer spoke with Successful Farming
 magazine about what drew him into the law field, how he gained an impressive understanding of HPAI and related regulations during the 2014–15 outbreak, and some advice for farmers during the current outbreak. 


 BD: I decided to go to law school because I was, believe it or not, in a rock and roll band, and the manager of the band was in law school himself. He kind of talked me into it. I went to the University of Pittsburgh Law School, and then when I got out, I was looking to get away from the city. Lancaster County in Pennsylvania [west of Philadelphia] had an opening. 

 I got into private practice, and you can’t really be in a town like this without representing agriculture clientele in various forms. I really enjoyed understanding a bit more about how people make a living in this industry and all of the moving parts. 


 Around 2007 I went up to the Department of Agriculture, and I became the chief counsel there in short order. I worked there for 12 years, and eight of those years I was the chief counsel. 


 It was such a great education. If I had known the interesting aspects of being an in-house attorney for an agricultural regulator, I probably would’ve done it a lot earlier. That was just an eye-opening experience, a great 12 years.


 When you’re outside of government, you don’t always see how hard some people work at it and how much they put into it. That really did kind of turn my head around, you know? This is a worthwhile endeavor, from the government standpoint, to try to make these programs work better, try to make things happen in the best possible way for farmers and other agriculture stakeholders.


 I came in from the outside, not being a longtime government lawyer. Luckily, when I got there, I had a good staff who had experience. I just picked up everything I could from these people. 


 When you’re in private practice, people expect you to get a result. That’s what they’re paying you for. I think that was something I brought from the outside. In government I tried to just apply the same thing, which is, if they brought me into this, then they expect me to achieve something.


 BD: In Pennsylvania at that time, we were obviously concerned about the spread east, toward us. Like most of the Mid-Atlantic portion of the country, we have very high numbers in terms of poultry production, so we were watching very intently. 


 Everybody was doing the same thing, which was learning how USDA was handling all of the big questions, whether it was how do you dispose of carcasses or how you do the depopulation — what’s working, what’s not working. We were also very intently watching the relationship of USDA with farmers.


 We were very intent on trying to make sure that this went well, if it ever happened here. We used to have a lot of these tabletop exercises where we would do simulations and start to learn the processes. 


 When you are in agriculture, you understand the major animal diseases. You understand on paper what these are, but you don’t necessarily have firsthand experience with them. Very few people do. But the 2014–15 outbreak gave some people firsthand experience, and it gave others a chance to watch that. It certainly improved everybody’s understanding of what you do, and it improved the USDA’s and [the agency's Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service] operations immensely.


 In the federal system, animal disease control is a highly technical little niche. Animal disease control, when you work at the state level, is much more visible, and the gravity of it, I think, becomes more real. If this part of your state department of agriculture doesn’t work well or doesn’t have the resources to function at its ideal capacity in times of crisis, then that’s not a good situation for the state.


 BD: Absolutely nothing, to be honest with you. I remember walking in, and the gentleman who was the chief counsel before me gave me some orientation to a few things. He handed me this avian influenza pandemic emergency plan. I had this vague memory of avian influenza having some ability to cross over to people, but I really didn’t have any kind of firm foundation and understanding. I really opened the books and started understanding what was going on in 2014. I was there from 2007 to 2014 before I really had to get into it.


 I was always fascinated by the amount of authority that was given to the state veterinarians and the animal health personnel under our state law to do things immediately by orders. Quarantine orders can be quite expansive and burdensome, so it’s quite interesting to watch that kind of authority be used judiciously. 


 You watch the level of expertise from the regulatory people, veterinarians, and others — you get a new respect for the depth of their knowledge. It takes many minds to put together these quarantine orders. 


 When you first get into government as a lawyer, you want to live a bit by the premise of “Why do you do it that way?” It’s good to push your people to examine why something is done a certain way, and “Just because we always did it that way” isn’t the answer. You have to think further than that. 


 But then, on the other hand, you gain a new respect for why it’s done that way. When you start getting into things as drastic as quarantine orders, you start to realize that because it’s always been done that way — has history to it — it’s a history worth figuring out before you change it. 


 In the course of all of these HPAI measures that are being taken, we have not had any standoffs where people aren’t letting the USDA officials in or they aren’t listening. I’m amazed at how civil this has been done — the quarantine orders and other measures — since 2014. There’s been cooperation. Rationality has won out in the execution of these disease control measures, which is something to be very thankful for. 


 
BD: Your animal health veterinarian staff, whether it’s your state staff, or your USDA staff in this particular instance, are some of your greatest assets. Gain as much knowledge from these people as you can while you’re around them, because it’ll help you think about the problems better in the future. 


 Try to look at their perspective and understand why things are the way they are, and then have a discussion about it. Learning from all of these professionals that are in this field and have been in this field for a long time is so key to this.

Chuck Abbott," The farm bill coalition — the rural and urban alliance credited with carrying farm bills to enactment — “is a one-sided talking point,” said House Agriculture chairman 
 on Tuesday in insisting on a $53 billion increase in farm subsidies and cuts in SNAP. Time is running out for passage of the new farm bill this year, and farm groups, silent for weeks, are now calling for prompt congressional action.

 Election-year politics soon will freeze legislative progress in the already polarized House and Senate. The House was not expected to vote until after Labor Day on the farm bill that was approved by its Agriculture Committee before Memorial Day. The only hope may be passage of a House-Senate compromise bill after the Nov. 5 general elections.

 “I will not apologize for advancing a bill that seeks to put the farm back in the farm bill,” said Thompson, who combines affability with red-meat rhetoric, at a committee hearing on agricultural finances. “The romanticized ‘farm bill coalition’ often talked about is a one-sided talking point.”

 After describing Senate Agriculture chairwoman Debbie Stabenow as “a meddling Senate Democrat,” Thompson said he was open to “an informal pre-conference negotiation with the Senate” on make-up of the farm bill. Stabenow aides said Thompson proposed huge increases in farm spending without paying for it and bill unduly favors Southern growers over farmers in the Midwest and Plains.

 Stabenow has said she will not accept cuts in SNAP or removal of “guardrails” on climate funding; both are goals of House and Senate Republicans. She has proposed increases of at least 5% in so-called reference prices for major crops. The House bill and a Senate Republican “framework” call for an average 15% increase.

 “A farm bill is not passed through slogans and posturing,” said Stabenow’s office. “The path to passing a bipartisan farm bill has always been holding together the broad farm and food coalition that has formed the foundation of every successful bill for decades.”

 At the House hearing, Thompson said his committee-approved farm bill “represents the largest permanent investment in the farm safety net, conservation, trade promotion, specialty crops, research, and livestock biosecurity in more than two decades.”

 Republicans would foolishly restrict USDA access to emergency funds at the same time their nominee for the White House, former president Donald Trump, might start a new trade war, said Georgia Rep. 
, the senior Democrat on the House Agriculture Committee. The Trump administration tapped the USDA fund for $23 billion in aid to farmers during the Sino-U.S. trade war.

 “Bottom line, if we want to get a farm bill done this year, as these witnesses want, we have to find a different way to pay for it without locking away this important tool for five years,” said Scott.

 “My door remains open to negotiation from any partner willing to come to the table with a serious proposal, not more red lines,” said Thompson. Scott said he was willing to work on bipartisan improvements to the farm bill, “But you must be open to change.”

 Farm Belt witnesses described extreme financial stress from high production costs and multi-year decline in commodity prices. Minnesota crop and dairy farmer Dana Allen-Tully said a farm bailout package may be needed because farmers cannot make a profit at current market prices for corn and soybeans. North Carolina cotton farmer David Dunlow said “another straight extension of the current farm bill is unacceptable….many farmers like me and others across the country will not be farming next year without some sort of assistance.”

 “Bankers believe they may be ‘looking over a cliff’ in regard to the agricultural economy without changes to current government policy,” said Tony Hotchkiss, of the American Bankers Association. “This includes adjustments to reference prices and ensuring that crop insurance covers loss appropriately for producers.”

 USDA forecasts of 
, an indicator of profitability, are more sanguine. Net income was a record $185.5 billion in 2022 and is forecast at $116.1 billion this year, a steep decline but still the fourth-highest net income on record and 15% above its 10-year average. The debt-to-asset ratio would rise slightly this year to 12.8%, a moderate level. The USDA was scheduled to update its forecast on Sept. 5.

 Northern California’s Park Fire has surpassed 360,000 acres and triggered evacuation orders affecting four counties, 
. The network added that by Sunday morning, containment had increased to 12%, according to Cal Fire.

 The state issued evacuation orders for four northern counties — Butte, Plumas, Shasta, and Tehama — the network's Richard Ramos, Brandon Downs, and Cecilio Padilla reported Sunday. They said the state's largest wildfire this year and California's seventh-largest ever has scorched an area more than five times the size of the city of Sacramento.

 The wildfire has threatened cattle, bees, and other livestock as it advanced into Tehama County from its starting point in north Chico, 
. “It has been a rough six years for agribusiness owners in Butte and Tehama counties, who fought to save their farms from two other major wildfires and numerous smaller fires,” Skropanic reported.

 Smoke settling in the valley can make harvesting difficult and unpleasant for farmers, but ranchers and honeybee keepers are directly in the fire’s path, Rory Crowley, a commercial agribusiness loan officer in Paradise, told Skropanic. “They’re on summer range, which is up in the mountains,” he said. “Cattle and bees need water, so they summer at higher altitudes.”

 Area ranchers under evacuation orders were hesitant to leave their stock, Crowley told the newspaper.

 Eastern Oregon’s Durkee Fire is affecting farmers and ranchers in that region, 
. “Ranchers in Vale told KGW there’s no way to know at this time just how many cattle — and ranches — have been lost to the flames,” she said.

 Rancher Mark McBride told McCarty the blaze was “completely devastating,” noting one of his family's ranches was “right in the middle of it, and one of them is next to come if we can’t get it stopped.” McBride, also a volunteer firefighter for Vale Rangeland Fire Protection Association, added: “High emotions, high losses. And it will remain that way for a generation.”

 The fire forced a rancher in far eastern Oregon's Rye Valley to leave behind 150 pair of mothers and calves, a wildfire fighter told an Idaho TV reporter. Blake Maxwell, based in Montana, 
 that if the cattle survive, they are most likely sick or injured.

 “I watched fire corral these cows in the corner of a pasture,” Maxwell told Shumpert, of KTVB. “I tried to get up there and cut the fence for them, and I couldn’t quite get there in time.” Shumpert said it was unsure if the cattle survived because the area has not been surveyed.

 “A lot of those ranchers they may have to sell off most of their cows, take them to the sale barn, because they can’t afford to feed them, because the grass they’re depending on is now ash on the ground,” Maxwell told the reporter.

 Summit Carbon Solutions argues that the main components of two county ordinances in Iowa that sought to limit the placement of carbon dioxide pipelines are entirely overridden by the authority of state and federal regulators.

 The company reasserted those arguments in a recent brief in federal court — its response to 
 by Shelby and Story counties of 
 late last year that agreed with Summit. An injunction prevents the counties from enforcing the ordinances.

 The filings of written arguments by both sides of the case set the stage for oral arguments before a panel of Eighth Circuit U.S. Court of Appeals judges. The oral arguments are not yet scheduled. The judges are expected to issue a decision sometime next year.

 Summit seeks to build a 2,500-mile pipeline system in five states to transport captured carbon dioxide from ethanol producers to North Dakota, where the greenhouse gas would be pumped into the ground. It received preliminary approval in Iowa 
.

 The work is incentivized by generous federal tax credits with the goal of slowing climate change. But many opponents of the project worry about the safety of people and animals near the pipeline that might be suffocated if it ruptures.

 The county ordinances create minimum separation distances — or setbacks — between the pipelines and populated places, such as cities, homes and livestock buildings.

 The federal judge who ruled against the first county ordinances said, in part, they were so restrictive that they might make it impossible for a carbon dioxide pipeline to be built at all.

 A handful of ordinances that were adopted by other counties — most of which are also the target of pending lawsuits by Summit — were increasingly less restrictive. The most recent one was approved in April 
, which has not been sued. Summit has declined to comment on the matter.

 Chief Judge Stephanie Rose, of the federal Southern District of Iowa, said the Shelby and Story ordinances’ placement requirements are overruled by state regulators — the Iowa Utilities Commission — and that their safety-related provisions are the jurisdiction of federal regulators — the Pipeline and Hazardous Materials Safety Administration.

 Rose went further and decided that the counties’ placement requirements are also a safety feature and are overridden by PHMSA, but the agency itself has contradicted the judge.

 “Local governments have traditionally exercised broad powers to regulate land use, including setback distances and property development that includes development in the vicinity of pipelines,” wrote Alan Mayberry, a pipeline safety administrator for PHMSA, to Summit in September. “Nothing in the federal pipeline safety law impinges on these traditional prerogatives of local — or state — government, so long as officials do not attempt to regulate the field of pipeline safety preempted by federal law.”

 However, Summit argues Rose was correct about the relationship of setbacks and safety, and its attorneys point to an early version of Story’s ordinance: “Story County started down this path solely out of concern for pipeline safety,” attorney Ryan Koopmans wrote in the recent appeal brief. “The county’s first ordinance, No. 306, focused only on setbacks because there are ‘risks in the event of a spill or rupture.’”

 Summit further says county ordinance provisions that obviously pertain to safety — such as requirements to disclose certain information to local emergency officials to aid their potential response to a breach — is also PHMSA’s jurisdiction.

 As for determining the pipeline routes, Summit argues state law gives the Iowa Utilities Commission absolute authority: “It does not matter whether Summit or any other pipeline company could somehow thread the needle through the counties’ heavily restrictive setbacks, or whether the counties would grant variances and let the pipeline pass through anyway (and they clearly will not),” Koopmans wrote.

 The American Petroleum Institute, which lobbies for the nation’s oil and natural gas industries, and the Liquid Energy Pipeline Association also recently filed a brief in support of Summit’s positions.

 They said pipelines are vital to the U.S. economy, are the safest way to transport energy products, and that the ordinances would have “far-reaching ramifications and unintended consequences.”

 “PHMSA, and PHMSA alone, has the authority to regulate the safety of interstate pipelines,” wrote Christina Manfredi McKinley, an attorney who represents the groups. “The counties’ broad-based ordinances threaten to topple this balance, and with it, not just PHMSA’s nationwide system of pipeline safety standards, but also, millions of miles of pipeline systems that transport the nation’s energy commodities and support the nation’s economy. This observation is not hyperbolic. Far from it. … The court should not countenance the counties’ vaguely cloaked attempts to legislate beyond the scope of their authority, however disguised.”

 The ultimate effect of the court action on the pending lawsuits against other counties is not yet clear. They have been paused until the Shelby and Story appeals conclude.

 PHMSA is in the process of revamping its safety standards for carbon dioxide pipelines, and the counties have said the current rules are not adequate to protect the public. They argue that there is room for some measure of local control of the issue.

Chuck Abbott," Farmers are on track to harvest some of their largest corn and soybean crops ever, but the ongoing decline in commodity prices is putting farm income in question, said the 
 issued by the Federal Reserve Board on Wednesday. Regional Fed banks in Chicago and Minneapolis said the farm income outlook had weakened in recent weeks, while the Kansas City Fed said agricultural conditions in its district “faced headwinds from weak crop prices.”

 Meanwhile, a handful of Federal Reserve officials indicated that a cut in interest rates may soon be possible, though not before the board’s September meeting, reported 
. The U.S. inflation rate fell to 3% in June, its lowest level in more than three years.

 In the Beige Book, released eight times a year, the 12 regional Fed banks report on economic conditions in their regions. The anecdotal reports are based on interviews with business contacts, economists, market experts, and other sources as well as on reports by the regional banks.

 “Farm income expectations for the district waned in late May and June as key crop prices declined,” said the Chicago Fed. “Contacts indicated that farmers were slow to sell crops from storage and were holding back on selling ahead from their anticipated fall harvest in part because of low prices.” Market prices for corn, soybeans, and wheat were down, and hog prices faltered. Milk and egg prices were up. “Cattle prices were flat at a high level,” said the Chicago Fed.

 The Minneapolis Fed said agricultural conditions had weakened since May. Ag lenders report “decreased farm incomes in the second quarter of 2024 relative to a year earlier, with expectations of further declines in the coming three months,” it said. Poultry producers were worried by outbreaks of bird flu in the region.

 “The latest planting estimates and favorable growing conditions suggested corn and soybean production could be strong, factors likely to weigh on prices,” said the Kansas City Fed. “Grain stocks from last year also remained elevated in district states and across the United States, putting additional downward pressure on prices and reducing revenue opportunities.” Cattle prices remained strong in the central Plains, so financial stress was lower in cattle-producing areas and higher on row-crop farms.

 The St. Louis Fed said crop conditions were stable “with high rainfall mitigating excessive heat. Contacts in agriculture equipment and services stated the slowdown in transactions relative to their peak in 2021-22 has continued.”

 U.S. net farm income, a gauge of profitability, is forecast by the USDA to fall in 2024 for the second year in a row from the record set in 2022. At $116.1 billion, it would be the fourth-highest level ever and 15% above its 10-year average in nominal terms.

 Agriculture conditions improved slightly in the U.S. Southeast, thanks to strong cattle, poultry, and dairy prices, said the Atlanta Fed. “Florida citrus farmers struggled as harvests were disappointing, leading to expectations of more growers leaving the market over the next year.” In the Southwest, drought has eased, and “livestock conditions were strong, with little to no supplemental feeding needed thanks to ample availability of grazing and hay, and cattle prices continued to strengthen,” said the Dallas Fed.

 On the West Coast, large inventories of apples, grapes, raisins, walnuts, almonds, and frozen salmon have depressed market prices below the cost of production, said the San Francisco Fed.

Noah Rohlfing," Michigan’s wheat harvest is moving along at a rapid speed — and a recent change in the weather is part of the reason why. 

 Following a wet June and early July for much of Michigan’s lower peninsula — particularly in the western half of the state, according to data from the Iowa Environmental Mesonet — the last two weeks have seen drier conditions throughout the state. This has allowed harvest to take off: As of the most recent U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) Crop Progress report on July 29, Michigan is 90% finished with the winter wheat harvest. 

 This is 32 percentage points ahead of wheat harvest progress at the same point in 2023, and 20 percentage points ahead of the state’s five-year average. 

 Also running ahead of schedule is Michigan’s oat harvest. As of July 29, 31% of the oat crop in the state has been harvested. The five-year average for Michigan is only 2%, and in 2023 at this stage of the year only 5% of the crop was harvested. 

 Range and pasture conditions in the state were also positive, with 77% labeled as Good/Excellent. Less rain meant hay second cuttings were at 46% complete, per the Michigan-specific Crop Progress report from the National Agricultural Statistics Service (NASS). 

 In southwestern Michigan, field crops have made progress after a reprieve from rain allowed standing water to drain from soybean fields, according to the 
. However, Extension reporters Nicolle Ritchie and Angie Gradiz did provide some detail about the impact the standing water has had on the area’s soybean crops.

 “Many soybeans are stunted and yellow from standing in pooled water caused by the heavy rains earlier this month,” Ritchie and Gradiz wrote. “This free water provides favorable conditions for Phytophthora stem and root rot infection.”

 Currently, 59% of Michigan’s soybean crop is in Good/Excellent condition. Soybeans are setting pods at 34% as of July 29, four percentage points below the state’s five-year average. Blooming is at 77%. 

 July was still wetter than average overall in the state, with chunks of southwestern, central, and eastern Michigan seeing upwards of 5 inches of precipitation more than the July average. Most of the Upper Peninsula was below its average for July, according to the Iowa Environmental Mesonet. 

 Rainfall throughout the growing season has left Michigan with only 3% of the state experiencing abnormally dry conditions, according to the latest data from the U.S. Drought Monitor. 

 The short-term predictions from the National Weather Service‘s Climate Prediction Center put most of Michigan with a higher-than-average chance of lower temperatures from Aug. 8 to Aug. 14, in tandem with a majority of the northern Corn Belt states. In addition, expectations are that Michigan will receive above-average precipitation over the same time period. 

 This runs counter to what the CPC predicts for the state overall for August — mainly above-average temperatures and equal chances of higher or lower precipitation. 

 Above-average temperatures are also expected in Michigan for September and October as growing season transitions into harvest time, the CPC said. Michigan is far from alone in this expectation: Only northern Minnesota and eastern North Dakota are not projected to experience above-average temps over the same time period. 

 Precipitation predictions have so far declined to move Michigan one way or the other.

 Seventy-six percent of the U.S. winter wheat crop was harvested at the start of this week, up from 71% seven days earlier and above the five-year average 72%, according to the USDA. 

 Earlier this month the agency raised its forecast for global stockpiles at the end of the 2024/2025 marketing year (ending May 31) to 257.2 million metric tons from 252.3 million tons.

 The agency also raised its outlook for U.S. inventories to 23.3 million metric tons from 20.6 million a month earlier. 

 Russian grain output, which had been threatened by dry weather and frost throughout the growing season, may be better than previously expected. Production is now forecast at 130.5 million metric tons, up from 127.4 million tons, consultant SovEcon said. The consultant raised its forecast for wheat production to 84.2 million tons.

 Corn futures for December delivery rose ¾¢ to $4.18¾ a bushel.

 Soybean futures for November delivery fell 2¢ to $10.61 a bushel. Soy meal lost 50¢ to $320.10 a short ton. Soy oil was down 0.16¢ to 43.94¢ a pound. 

 Ethanol output declined in the seven days ending on July 19, according to the Energy Information Administration (EIA). Production of the biofuel fell to an average 1.095 million barrels a day, the agency said. That’s down from an average 1.106 million barrels the previous week. 

 In the Midwest, by far the biggest producing region, output dropped to 1.035 million barrels, on average, from 1.046 million the week prior. Gulf Coast production fell to 26,000 barrels a day from 28,000, and West Coast output declined to 9,000 barrels from 10,000 the previous week, EIA said. 

 East Coast output was steady at 12,000 barrels a day, on average, and Rocky Mountain production rose to 12,000 barrels from 10,000 barrels a week earlier. 

 Ethanol stockpiles through July 19, meanwhile, jumped to 23.723 million barrels, EIA said. That’s the highest level since May 17, and up from 23.16 million a week earlier. 

 Excessive heat warnings, red flag warnings and heat advisories have been issued for parts of Montana and western North Dakota and South Dakota, according to the National Weather Service (NWS).

Chuck Abbott," Except for the “lame duck long shot” of a post-election compromise, the slim chances that Congress will pass a new farm bill this year “have become nonexistent,” farm policy expert 
 said Thursday. The primary reason is the “long-unspecified demand” by Republicans for higher crop subsidy spending without providing details, wrote Coppess, a USDA official during the Obama era, at the farmdoc daily blog.

 Progress on the farm bill was also mired in disagreements over SNAP cuts and climate funding. Congress is nearly 10 months late in replacing the 2018 farm law.

 Earlier this week during a 
, House Agriculture Committee chair Glenn Thompson (R-Pa.) said it would be September before the farm bill is debated in the House. The senior Republican on the Senate Agriculture Committee, John Boozman of Arkansas, said, “If we can’t make a meaningful change” in the so-called reference prices that trigger subsidy payments, “I think we’re better off with an extension” of current law into 2025.

 The already slim chances of farm bill reauthorization in 2024 “are wilting in the summer heat, facing a legislative calendar almost out of days,” Coppess said. He added that the farm bill approved by the House Agriculture Committee on May 24 “lacks a viable path with the budget and political problems facing it.”

 The bill would increase crop subsidy and crop insurance outlays by one-third from current levels but offsets only part of the cost, according to the Congressional Budget Office. The bill also would cut SNAP spending. House Republicans unsuccessfully sought SNAP cuts in the 2014 and 2018 farm laws.

 “All that remains is an outside chance” of agreement on a farm bill after the Nov. 5 general election —the “lame duck long shot,” Coppess said. “It is more likely that any lame duck session will merely extend the 2018 farm bill again.”

 The farm bill is on the back burner in Congress, where annual government funding bills are at the top of the agenda. There has been little urgency in farm bill discussions.

 Higher reference prices and an expansion of crop insurance are long-standing farm bill priorities for farm groups. Lawmakers from farm states have often said they want “more farm in the farm bill.” Months passed, however, without a public statement of how large an increase was wanted in reference prices or how to pay for it.

 Boozman proposed a 15% increase in reference prices for row crops, such as corn, soybeans, and wheat, as part of a 
 released in June. The Republican-written farm bill in the House also calls for a 15% increase. Republican staff workers on the Senate Agriculture Committee said the cost of higher reference prices could be offset through savings in the farm bill baseline of $1.4 billion over 10 years.

Cassidy Walter," Today the USDA released the 17th Crop Progress report of the 2024 growing season.


 The USDA says as of July 21, 61% of the 2024 corn crop in the top 18 corn-growing states have reached the silk growth stage. This is up from 41% the week prior and ahead of the five-year average of 56%.

 The report says 17% of the corn crop across 17 of those states have reached the dough growth stage. This is up from 8% the week prior and ahead of the five-year average of 11%.

 According to the report, the condition of the corn crop in the top growing states rates as follows:

Luis Vieira," Estimates for Brazil’s corn output continue to shrink. The total corn output is down 1.41 million metric tons (mmt) to 147.3 mmt, according to Brazil’s National Supply Company (Conab). This is 12.2% lower than last year’s output. The second corn crop was down 3.4% from the previous forecast to 88 mmt.

 The drop in production is attributed to a year with “intensified El Niño with an influence over the crops since the early plantings,” according to Conab.

 Harvest of safrinha — the second corn crop — is underway. In Mato Grosso, the largest corn producing state, harvest is 76% complete with 45% of the new crop sold, according to consultancy AgRural. Favorable weather has helped spur harvest along. This has not been the case in Mato Grosso do Sul where harvest is only 29% complete.

 In Paraná, the only southern state that plants safrinha, many regions have gone 40 days without rain, according to a local government agency. Harvest is underway with 66% complete and 21% of the crop is considered under poor conditions. 


 Rain is in the forecast for this week in Paraná, according to Climatempo. West-central states, such as Mato Grosso, Mato Grosso do Sul, and Goiás, may face storms, which could mean multiple harvest delays this week.


 The main talking point in the market among producers is the currency devaluation and its impact on the price received by producers. On July 12, 1 U.S. dollar would buy 5.42 Brazilian real. In January, $1 could purchase 4.95 Brazilian real.


 While the amount received in local currency has increased due to currency devaluation, fertilizer costs are down, reducing the amount spent on inputs.


 Argentina has finished soybean harvest with final production at 50 mmt. 


 Estimates for corn harvest remain at 46.5 mmt, according to the Buenos Aires Cereal Exchange. Harvest continues to progress well with 70% complete. 


 Wheat planting in Argentina is almost complete with 93% done and 97% of that in good or excellent condition, according to the Buenos Aires Cereal Exchange.

 The Colorado Department of Agriculture will now require regular testing of dairy milk as the highly pathogenic H5N1 avian influenza — bird flu — continues to spread throughout the state. 

 Commercial cow dairy farms licensed by the Colorado Department of Public Health and Environment that are not already under a bird flu-related quarantine will undergo weekly testing of bulk samples. This will include facilities with dairy cattle used to produce milk, butter, pasteurized and other cheeses, frozen desserts, ice cream, dry milk, condensed milk and cottage cheese, among other products for human consumption. 

 The state issued 
 on Monday.

 “We have been navigating this challenging, novel outbreak of (bird flu) in dairy operations for nearly three months in Colorado and have not been able to curb the spread of disease at this point,” Dr. Maggie Baldwin, the Colorado state veterinarian, said in a statement. “We have seen devastating impacts of this disease not only to our dairy industry, but our poultry industry as well. With the strong support of the dairy and poultry industries, we feel that this is the best next step in order to protect these vital industries in our state.”

 In the last 30 days, 30 cattle herds in Colorado have been affected by the virus, according to the 
. According to the 
, 39 flocks in Colorado have had a bird flu outbreak, including both poultry and non-poultry. 
 in Colorado have contracted the virus, the most of any other state in the country. Seven of those people work on poultry farms, while one works on a dairy farm.

 Under the mandate, samples collected from farms will be tested at the Colorado State University Veterinary Diagnostic Laboratory, and any farm whose dairy produces a non-negative test result for H5N1 will be placed under quarantine. 

 The order mandating testing does not have a set expiration date, so state agricultural leaders or the state veterinarian must issue another order to cease testing. Any farms that fail to comply with the requirements of the order will be referred to the Colorado attorney general’s office.

 “We appreciate the ongoing cooperation and partnership with both the poultry and dairy industries,” Colorado Commissioner of Agriculture Kate Greenberg said in a statement. “Mandatory surveillance of highly pathogenic avian influenza across all of Colorado’s Grade A commercial dairies is a critical next step to tamping down the virus and protecting the food system. Ongoing cooperation is key to supporting workers’ health and safety, protecting animal health and welfare, and minimizing the spread of the virus.”

 CDPHE says it is safe to eat properly handled and cooked poultry products, as the proper handling and cooking of meat and eggs kills viruses. The risk of bird flu to the general public is low and there has not been evidence of the virus spreading from person to person.

Chuck Abbott," Farmers are on track to harvest some of their largest corn and soybean crops ever, but the ongoing decline in commodity prices is putting farm income in question, said the 
 issued by the Federal Reserve Board on Wednesday. Regional Fed banks in Chicago and Minneapolis said the farm income outlook had weakened in recent weeks, while the Kansas City Fed said agricultural conditions in its district “faced headwinds from weak crop prices.”

 Meanwhile, a handful of Federal Reserve officials indicated that a cut in interest rates may soon be possible, though not before the board’s September meeting, reported 
. The U.S. inflation rate fell to 3% in June, its lowest level in more than three years.

 In the Beige Book, released eight times a year, the 12 regional Fed banks report on economic conditions in their regions. The anecdotal reports are based on interviews with business contacts, economists, market experts, and other sources as well as on reports by the regional banks.

 “Farm income expectations for the district waned in late May and June as key crop prices declined,” said the Chicago Fed. “Contacts indicated that farmers were slow to sell crops from storage and were holding back on selling ahead from their anticipated fall harvest in part because of low prices.” Market prices for corn, soybeans, and wheat were down, and hog prices faltered. Milk and egg prices were up. “Cattle prices were flat at a high level,” said the Chicago Fed.

 The Minneapolis Fed said agricultural conditions had weakened since May. Ag lenders report “decreased farm incomes in the second quarter of 2024 relative to a year earlier, with expectations of further declines in the coming three months,” it said. Poultry producers were worried by outbreaks of bird flu in the region.

 “The latest planting estimates and favorable growing conditions suggested corn and soybean production could be strong, factors likely to weigh on prices,” said the Kansas City Fed. “Grain stocks from last year also remained elevated in district states and across the United States, putting additional downward pressure on prices and reducing revenue opportunities.” Cattle prices remained strong in the central Plains, so financial stress was lower in cattle-producing areas and higher on row-crop farms.

 The St. Louis Fed said crop conditions were stable “with high rainfall mitigating excessive heat. Contacts in agriculture equipment and services stated the slowdown in transactions relative to their peak in 2021-22 has continued.”

 U.S. net farm income, a gauge of profitability, is forecast by the USDA to fall in 2024 for the second year in a row from the record set in 2022. At $116.1 billion, it would be the fourth-highest level ever and 15% above its 10-year average in nominal terms.

 Agriculture conditions improved slightly in the U.S. Southeast, thanks to strong cattle, poultry, and dairy prices, said the Atlanta Fed. “Florida citrus farmers struggled as harvests were disappointing, leading to expectations of more growers leaving the market over the next year.” In the Southwest, drought has eased, and “livestock conditions were strong, with little to no supplemental feeding needed thanks to ample availability of grazing and hay, and cattle prices continued to strengthen,” said the Dallas Fed.

 On the West Coast, large inventories of apples, grapes, raisins, walnuts, almonds, and frozen salmon have depressed market prices below the cost of production, said the San Francisco Fed.

 With the USDA cancelling its regularly scheduled July cattle inventory report due to budget cuts, a question that many would like to have answered is: How big is the U.S. cattle herd?

 Fortunately, historical relationships between changes in prior and subsequent inventories and levels of cow slaughter in between or heifers’ share of cattle on feed offer some indication. These negative relationships respectively explain 30% and 50% of the variation in changes in cattle inventory from one July to the next. While the share of January cow inventory that is slaughtered by July has dropped from 8.75% in 2003 to 7.76% in 2004, suggesting a slowing of cow herd liquidation, the current level still corresponds to a reduction in the July over July total inventory, as does the proportion of feedlot cattle that are heifers, currently at 39.6% compared to 39.9% last July.

 A model incorporating both variables explains 61% of inventory changes and estimates the July 1 U.S. cattle inventory to be 94.2 million head or 1.2% lower than in July 2023.
 Hence, it appears the U.S. cattle industry overall remains in a contractionary phase, even if there may be regional pockets of expansion.

 The USDA’s most recent Cattle on Feed report indicates that feedlots placed 1.56 million head on-feed and marketed 1.79 million last June or about 7% fewer placements and 9% fewer marketings than in the prior June, bringing the July 1 total number of cattle on feed to 11.3 million head or just about 1% more than last July.

 With a 0.8% increase in steers on-feed relative to last July and a nearly unchanged (0.1% increase) number of heifers, the latter’s share of cattle on feed, as already mentioned, also remains similar to a year ago at nearly 40%, as compared to only 31%-33% during much of the last expansion. Such a statistic typically indicates a reduction in replacement heifers, as producers remain reluctant to rebuild the breeding herd.

 Given the low inventory and cattle on feed numbers, beef production is anticipated to be 1.1% lower in 2024 than last year and then drop another 4.5% in 2025. Accordingly, per capita beef consumption is expected remain near 58 pounds per person in 2024 and then decrease 3.26% to 56.3 pounds per person in 2025. Based on stronger than anticipated global demand, the USDA in its Livestock, Dairy, and Poultry Outlook revised projections of beef exports upward, now just 4.3% lower this year than the last and left unchanged a further 14.0% projected decline for 2025.

 Following records in 2021 and again in 2022, beef exports dropped about 14.3% lower in 2023, and the 2024 projection returns to within 1.5% of the 2020 level, while projected declines for 2025 bring beef exports down to levels not seen since 2016. Still, as a result of currently strong demand and declining production, cold stocks of beef are already fairly low. According to the USDA’s June Cold Storage Report beef stocks on May 31 are down 3.4% from a month earlier and 0.5% from last year.

 All things considered, prices are likely to remain above year ago levels. Quarterly prices for slaughter steers are forecast to average about $191.48/cwt and $199.08/cwt for the last two quarters of 2024, and $204.60/cwt and $209.12/cwt for the first two quarters of 2025. For 600-700 pound feeder steers, prices are forecast to average about $286.38/cwt and $277.88/cwt for the last two quarters of 2024, and $293.31/cwt and $301.50/cwt for the first two quarters of 2025.

 These projections reflect tight supplies and declining but resilient domestic consumption and export demand. If demand declines even more than anticipated or a larger herd exists than indicated by this analysis, then lower prices may result.

Tony Dreibus," Soybean and grain futures surged in overnight trading on technical buying and amid some global weather concerns.

 Futures may be oversold, leading investors to liquidate their net-short positions, or bets on lower prices, and buy back futures contracts. 

 Giving prices a boost overnight are signs of demand for U.S. agricultural products. 

 Exporters sold 105,000 metric tons of soy meal for delivery in the 2024–2025 marketing year to an unidentified country, the USDA said in a report last week. 

 The USDA also said exporters sold 510,000 metric tons of soybeans to unidentified destinations to be delivered in the next marketing year. A separate sale of 150,000 metric tons of soy meal was also announced. 

 Commodity Weather Group said in a note to clients that parts of Saskatchewan and Alberta, both large wheat- and canola-growing provinces in Canada, may slip drier and are at risk for crop losses. 

 Still, ample rain has fallen in parts of the U.S. Corn Belt — too much in some areas, as flooding is ongoing — that has kept crops hydrated. 

 Soybean futures for November delivery jumped 19½¢ to $10.55½ a bushel overnight on the Chicago Board of Trade (CBOT). Soymeal added $6.20 to $313.70 a short ton, and soy oil was up 0.57¢ to 44.54¢ a pound. 

 Corn futures for December delivery gained 6½¢ to $4.11¼ a bushel.

 Wheat futures for September delivery rose 4¢ to $5.46¾ a bushel, while Kansas City futures added 1¾¢ to $5.71¾ a bushel. 

 Investors reduced their net-short positions, or bets on lower prices, in corn futures in the seven days that ended July 16, according to the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC).

 Speculators held a net 352,772 futures contracts in corn, down from 356,415 contracts a week earlier, the agency said. 

 Money managers raised their bearish bets on soybean futures to 183,145 futures contracts, CFTC said. That’s up from 162,803 contracts the week prior. 

 In wheat, investors were more bearish week to week. 

 Hedge fund managers and other large investment firms held 72,831 futures contracts in soft red winter wheat, up from 68,692 contracts seven days earlier. 

 Investors held 44,624 hard red winter wheat contracts, up from 40,893 contracts the previous week, CFTC said in its report. 

 The weekly Commitment of Traders report from the CFTC shows trader positions in futures markets.

 The report provides positions held by commercial traders, or those using futures to hedge their physical assets; noncommercial traders, or money managers (also called large speculators); and nonreportables, or small speculators.

 A net-long position indicates more traders are betting on higher prices, while a net-short position means more are betting futures will decline.

 The meat inspection law governs the operations of slaughterhouses and does not extend to state laws on meat marketing, contrary to Triumph Foods’ interpretation, wrote Young. Triumph and the farmers who are its member-owners are not obliged to ship whole pork cuts to Massachusetts, said the judge, who noted that Triumph segregates its products for sale as organic, grass-fed, and other specialty categories.

 Legislators, counties, conservation groups and landowners have asked state regulators to reconsider their permit approval for an expansive carbon dioxide pipeline system in Iowa.

 A total of eight requests were filed with the Iowa Utilities Commission in the past week before a procedural deadline on Monday, and they 
 to lawsuits in state court.

 The commission last month 
 by Summit Carbon Solutions to construct about 690 miles of pipe in Iowa to transport captured carbon dioxide from ethanol plants. The company has already 
 its footprint by more than 300 feet to connect to more of the facilities.

 The reconsideration requests were filed by:

 — 
, a conservation group that has been key to organizing opposition to the project.
— 
, a group of 26 state representatives and 11 state senators who oppose the use of eminent domain for the project.
— 
, an attorney who is the leading representative of affected landowners who oppose the project.
—

— 
— 
, a landowner in Emmet County.
— 
, landowners in Lyon County.
— 
, which was originally formed to oppose the Dakota Access oil pipeline. It advocates for climate change solutions and opposes eminent domain for the pipelines.

 Opposition to the use of eminent domain — in which Summit will be able to force unwilling landowners to host its pipeline network — is a common thread of the objections. A Des Moines Register/Mediacom Iowa Poll last year showed that 78% of Iowans 
.

 “The bottom line is that a private entity like Summit cannot be granted the power of eminent domain unless it is a common carrier,” the Sierra Club wrote in its Monday reconsideration request. “But the evidence showed that Summit is not a common carrier. It will be contracting individually with ethanol plants, not the public generally, and it will own the carbon dioxide, so it will be carrying its own product, not carrying a product for hire.”

 The IUC used a self-designed “balancing test” that considered a number of factors to determine whether the project benefits the public. That test 
 a permit for Summit, and those who oppose the project say its conclusions were flawed.

 The group of Republican lawmakers further said the IUC’s process precluded input from many people who might be affected by the project, including those who live close enough to the pipeline route to be threatened by a potential pipeline breach but far enough away to not be in the pipeline’s direct path.

 Catastrophic pipeline failures

 “A significant number of Iowans – those who are in the kill zone but who are not yet aware of their status – have been excluded from even rudimentary due process in the IUC’s consideration of the Summit application,” the lawmakers wrote.

 The three-member IUC has 30 days to respond to the requests, after which the groups can take their objections to court.

 Summit wants to lay about 2,500 miles of pipe in five states to transport the greenhouse gas to North Dakota for underground storage. It has not yet obtained permits in North and South Dakota, which is a requirement for the company to start construction in Iowa.

 Soaring temperatures made it difficult for farm workers to protect themselves from chickens recently infected by avian influenza in Colorado and likely contributed to five people contracting the virus, according to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.

 State health officials 
 last week — the largest cluster of human infections in the country since the bird flu outbreak began more than two years ago.

 Human infections are 
 to public health officials because they increase the likelihood that the virus could mutate to easily pass from person to person and spur a human pandemic. A total of 10 infections among people have been discovered since April 2022.

 But the virus found in the Colorado workers does not possess such a mutation, said Dr. Nirav Shah, principal deputy director for the CDC, in a Tuesday call with reporters. It’s believed they were each infected by egg-laying chickens as they sought to cull a flock of about 1.8 million in the northeast part of the state.

 It is customary to kill entire flocks when they are infected by highly pathogenic avian influenza — which readily infects and kills poultry — to prevent its spread to other flocks.

 The Colorado workers grabbed the chickens, placed them into containers that can hold dozens at a time, and asphyxiated them with carbon dioxide, said Dr. Julie Gauthier, executive director for field operations for the U.S. Department of Agriculture’s Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service.

 The workers typically wear suits, goggles, gloves, and boots, and they breathe through respirators that protect them from pathogens.

 But the outdoor temperature at the time of the work was about 100°, and the temperature inside the facility was likely hotter. Giant fans moved air to cool the inside, which circulated potentially virus-laden debris such as feathers.

 “The difficulty with wearing all that gear in that kind of heat, you can imagine,” Gauthier said, “and it was made more difficult by those fans pushing the air — made it hard to keep those goggles and N95 respirators in place.”

 The virus that infected the flock is similar to one that has infected dairy cattle in 13 states, Shah said. Colorado has had the most infected herds of any state, with at least 37. It’s possible that the virus was transported to the egg-laying flock from one of those herds, Shah said.

 Highly pathogenic avian influenza has been spread by wild birds and has been sporadically devastating for U.S. poultry flocks since January 2022. About 99 million birds in infected flocks have been destroyed, according to CDC data.

 Federal officials believe the virus passed from wild birds 
 in December. Since then it has spread to herds in other states, likely due to the transportation of infected cattle. From there it is believed to have spread locally to other herds and poultry flocks via people and their equipment, including farm workers and veterinarians.

 Colorado accounts for seven of the 10 known human infections in the United States that were the result of interactions with sick birds and cows. It had the first-ever infection of a poultry worker, in April 2022. Early this month, a Colorado dairy worker was also infected.

 The workers who were recently infected had mild symptoms of pink eye and respiratory illness.

 In the 1800s, the Fond du Lac Band of Lake Superior Chippewa joined other tribes in signing a pair of treaties with the federal government, giving up massive swaths of land in return for the creation of a reservation in eastern Minnesota. The treaties included a guarantee: Tribal members would be able to return in perpetuity to the lands they were signing away to gather wild rice, known as manoomin.

 “There’s a recognition that [manoomin] is a relative that figures very prominently in the Ojibwe migration story,” said Nancy Schuldt, water projects coordinator with the environmental program for the Fond du Lac Band of Lake Superior Chippewa. “It is one of the hallmarks of the how and the why [that] the Ojibwe people found themselves migrating to the western Great Lakes.”

 Retaining the right to harvest manoomin allowed tribal members to maintain a connection to their ancestral lands, even as they were forced to live within reservation boundaries. But wild rice is very sensitive to environmental conditions, and the tribe found that sulfate pollution from nearby mining threatened the waters on which their harvest depended.

 The tribe fought for decades to get the state of Minnesota to issue water quality standards to protect wild rice and, later, to enforce those standards. But Wisconsin, where the Fond du Lac Band also retains harvesting rights in certain areas, has been much slower to enact similar protections.

 Tribal leaders are hopeful that a new federal rule will change that.

 This May, the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency issued a revision to the Clean Water Act that requires states to consider tribal treaty rights when crafting water quality regulations. The rule could protect resources such as wild rice, sturgeon, salmon and shellfish.

 While many tribes have issued pollution standards for waters within their own boundaries, the federal rule will cover off-reservation landscapes on which Native people still exercise hard-won rights to hunt, fish and gather. Such areas cover millions of acres mapped out in dozens of treaties, concentrated especially in the Great Lakes and Pacific Northwest.

 State regulators have long been tasked with setting water quality standards for those areas. Now, the new rule directs them to consider the treaty-protected aquatic species that depend on those waters. For instance, states may be forced to lower pollution thresholds in some waters to account for the fact that tribal members who practice subsistence lifestyles consume fish at higher rates than the general public.

 Daniel Cordalis, an attorney with the Native American Rights Fund, a tribal advocacy group, said tribes have long been frustrated with some state regulators for setting regulations without tribal input.

 “Tribes have been asking for this for a long time,” he said. “These are federally based rights that need to be incorporated into the calculus as you’re developing or revising a water quality standard.”

 In Washington state, a landmark court decision in 1974 forced the state to recognize tribal fishing rights, and entitled tribal members to half of the harvestable catch. Officials with the Washington State Department of Ecology say they have a formal process for reaching out to tribal governments whenever they propose a new rule.

 In 2009, agency leaders began a dialogue with tribes over the state’s human health criteria. The agency had long relied on baseline federal figures — meaning pollution limits were set on an assumption that residents eat 6.5 grams of fish per day.

 After discussions with tribal groups, however, officials determined that the baseline figure was too low to protect tribal members whose diets are heavy in salmon and other culturally important aquatic species. Higher consumption rates made tribal members vulnerable to accumulations of mercury and other contaminants that fish can pick up in polluted water.

 “We knew it needed to be updated and be reflective of fish consumption that was really happening in Washington state by tribes,” said Melissa Gildersleeve, who oversees water quality standards for the agency. “We’ve gotten used to that conversation around tribal data.”

 In 2016, Washington state issued new criteria based on a consumption rate of 175 grams per day, nearly 30 times the previous assumption. Because of tribes’ right to harvest fish, waters throughout the state gained extra protections in order to ensure that right could be exercised safely.

 But other states have been more resistant, with a dozen joining a lawsuit seeking to get the new EPA rule thrown out. They argue that it treads on states’ delegated authority to set standards under the conditions laid out in the Clean Water Act, putting tribal interests before states’ judgment. The lawsuit also asserts that treaty rights are guarantees made by the federal government, and putting the onus on states to validate and uphold those rights gives them a near-impossible task.

 “This starkly conflicts with the [Clean Water Act’s] specific recognition, preservation, and protection of the States’ primary right and responsibility to establish designated uses and consequent water quality standards,” the plaintiffs wrote.

 The states challenging the rule are Alaska, Idaho, Iowa, Louisiana, Montana, Nebraska, North Dakota, South Carolina, South Dakota, Texas, Utah and Wyoming.

 Tribal leaders say that Idaho and other states in the case have long ignored tribes’ attempts to have their rights considered. They say the rule is necessary because states have demonstrated that they won’t listen to tribes unless they’re forced to.

 “Historically, it’s taken litigation to get states to recognize tribes’ rights, and that’s really expensive,” said Gussie Lord, managing attorney of the Tribal Partnerships Program with Earthjustice, an environmental law group. “This provides a framework for a process that has been divisive and adversarial.”

 Some other tribal advocates believe the rule, if upheld, could represent a massive shift. They note that pollution isn’t the only factor preventing the exercise of their rights. In some areas, irrigation for agriculture or the construction of dams have reduced water flows in rivers and choked off fish populations.

 “This could be one tool in restoring the flows back into these waterways,” said Ken Norton, chair of the National Tribal Water Council, a tribal advocacy group.

 The states opposing the rule fear the same outcome, arguing that it would conflict with states’ authority to delegate water rights.

 The rule could also require states to set higher standards even in waters where treaty rights aren’t currently being exercised. If tribes aren’t harvesting fish in a river because it’s polluted, states must consider what the harvest might look like if poor water quality didn’t prevent tribes from exercising their right.

 The EPA did not grant an interview request to discuss the rule and its implications.

, which describes itself as a blueprint for a new Trump administration, says the H-2A agricultural visa should be phased out over the next 10 to 20 years.

 Approximately 310,000 H-2A visas were issued by the State Department in 2023, up from 298,000 visas in 2022 and four times more than the 75,000 visas in 2010. Farmers say they have turned to the H-2A program because of the difficulty in recruiting farm labor. Half of farmworkers are believed to be undocumented, and many are reaching retirement age. The 275,000 H-2A guest workers of 2020 accounted for 10% of the average employment on crop farms, according to a 
.

 In March, a 
 unanimously recommended that the H-2A visa, now limited to seasonal work, also be available for year-round work on farms and in processing plants. “One thing that has become clear is the need for dairy products, meat processors, sugar processors, forestry, ranchers, and others to have access to a steady and legal workforce,” said the working group, composed of members of the House Agriculture Committee.

 Action is needed to “reform the H-2A wage system to reflect real-world wages better, while protecting against sudden wage increases that disrupt employer planning and operations,” said the working group. It suggested a wage freeze for 2025, followed by yearly increases of no more than 3.25% through 2029.

 The Trump administration proposed a two-year wage freeze for guest workers in 2020, just before the presidential election. Then Agriculture Secretary Sonny Perdue said the Labor Department regulation demonstrated “President Trump’s commitment to America’s farmers by delivering lower costs when they need it the most.” The minimum pay rates set by the Labor Department, known as adverse effect wage rates, are intended to prevent H-2A wages from undermining pay for American workers.

 Farmers frequently say the wage rates are burdensomely high. The American Farm Bureau Federation said it “supports short-term relief in the form of a justified pause in the minimum wage rate.” The H-2A program should be reformed to provide “flexibility for employers and workers by allowing employment options to address seasonal and year-round needs and a reasonable and mutually agreeable wage rate.”

 To the contrary, Project 2025 says, “The low cost of H-2A workers undercuts American workers in agricultural employment.”

 “Congress should immediately cap this program at its current levels and establish a schedule for its gradual and predictable phase-down over the subsequent 10 to 20 years, producing the necessary incentives for the industry to invest in raising productivity, including through capital investment in agricultural equipment, and increasing employment for Americans in the agricultural sector,” said Project 2025, shepherded by the Heritage Foundation. The Project 2025 chapter on the Labor Department notes the alternative argument that without guest workers, farmers would have to increase wages drastically and even then, not be certain of finding enough U.S.-born workers to bring food products to the market.

 The costs, time, and disruptions involved in deporting millions of people would be enormous, said the 
. One immigration expert said it would take billions of dollars and as long as 20 years to accomplish. During Trump’s tenure in office, the United States deported 936,000 people. Congress allotted $3.4 billion this year for deportation facilities holding an average 41,500 immigrants.

 Seventy-six percent of winter wheat were in the bin as of Sunday, up from 71% a week earlier and ahead of the prior five-year average 72%, the USDA said in a report. 

 Seventy-seven percent of U.S. spring wheat were in Good or Excellent condition at the start of the week, unchanged from seven days earlier but well ahead of the 49% that earned top ratings at the same point a year earlier, the agency said. 

 Eighty-nine percent of the crop were headed, up from 76% a week earlier but one percentage point behind the average for this time of year. 

 Underpinning prices, however, was a report from FranceAgriMer showing only 52% of the French crop in Good or Excellent shape as of about a week ago. That was down from 57% the previous week and 80% at this point last year. 

 Farmers in France have harvested 14% of their soft wheat, well behind the 51% in the bin at this time last year, FranceAgriMer said. 

 Soybean futures were modestly higher in overnight trading.

 Sixty-eight percent of U.S. beans were Good or Excellent as of Sunday, unchanged week to week but ahead of the 54% that earned top ratings a year earlier. 

 Twenty-nine percent of the crop were setting pods, up from 18% seven days earlier. Sixty-five percent were blooming versus 51% the previous week, the USDA said. 

 Corn ratings declined one percentage point, with 67% in Good or Excellent condition, the government said. Seventeen percent were in dough stage, up from 8% last week, and 61% were in silk stage, well above 41% seven days earlier. 

 Wheat futures for September delivery fell 5½¢ to $5.42½ a bushel overnight on the Chicago Board of Trade (CBOT). Kansas City futures lost 7¾¢ to $5.64 a bushel. 

 Soybean futures for November delivery rose 3¢ to $10.71¾ a bushel. Soy meal lost 10¢ to $319.30 a short ton. Soy oil was up 0.1¢ to 44.95¢ a pound. 

 Corn futures for December delivery fell ¾¢ to $4.14¼ a bushel.

 Inspections of corn and wheat for overseas delivery declined week to week, while soybean assessments increased, according to USDA data. 

 Corn inspections in the seven days ending July 18 dropped to 970,539 metric tons, the USDA said in a report late Monday. 

 Still, that's almost triple the amount inspected during the same week a year earlier. 

 Examinations of wheat for export declined to 237,965 tons, down from 620,707 tons a week earlier and 361,135 tons at the same point in 2023, the government said. 

 Soybean inspections, meanwhile, rose to 327,061 tons from 175,327 tons the week prior. The total was also higher than the 288,655 tons examined during the same week last year. 

 Since the start of the marketing year, on Sept. 1, the USDA has inspected 45.6 million metric tons of corn for overseas delivery. That’s up from the 34.3 million tons assessed during the same time frame a year earlier. 

 Soybean assessments since the beginning of September now stand at 42.4 million tons, down from the 50.2 million tons inspected in the same period last year. 

 Wheat inspections since the start of the grain’s marketing year on June 1 are at 2.59 million metric tons, up from the 2.16 million assessed at this point a year ago, the USDA said in its report. 

 Scattered showers are possible in parts of northwest Iowa, southwest Minnesota, northeast Nebraska, and southeast South Dakota, according to the National Weather Service. 

 Storms are forecast to start this morning and refire in the afternoon and evening, the NWS said. 

 Severe storms are not expected, but some small hail and occasional funnels or land-spout tornadoes could be possible today, along with brief, heavy rains, the agency said.

 In the southern Plains, scattered thunderstorms are forecast this afternoon and evening for much of Oklahoma, NWS said. 

 Severe weather is not in the forecast, the agency said.

Noah Rohlfing," June was an all-time wet month for Minnesota farmers. 

 According to the 
, June 2024 was the fourth-wettest June on record in the state and the fifth-wettest month in recorded Minnesota history. The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) reported the average June rainfall throughout the state was 6.78 inches. 

 Kenny Blumenfeld, senior climatologist for Minnesota, said a stretch in the middle of the month contributed heavily to the large rainfall totals.

 “In addition to a persistent, active pattern, we got stuck in an eight-day pattern where it just rained really, really hard,” Blumenfeld said.

 The impact of the consistent heavy precipitation has been stark, with flooding happening throughout the state. A 
 said nearly half of Minnesota was in flooding conditions because of high water levels on the Missouri, Minnesota, and Mississippi rivers. Blumenfeld said that even before heavy June rains, there were reports of flooding in agricultural areas that resulted in equipment being submerged in some fields.

 In the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) Crop Progress report released on July 8, Minnesota only had 2.9 days suitable for fieldwork during the first week of July. 
 said, “Heavy rain and saturated soils continue to restrict access to fields throughout much of the state. Some livestock losses were reported due to flash flooding.”

 Blumenfeld said there has been difficulties for farmers with the sheer amount of rainfall and subsequent floods. 

 “I took a drive because I was giving a talk to an ag group in June during the wet spell,” Blumenfeld said. “I lost count after I got to 15 different flooded farm fields on a stretch two hours west of the Twin Cities.

 “Not every producer, not every farmer in the state, but certainly quite a few in southern Minnesota have had some difficulties because of very wet fields. Even if they have tile drainage, it was too wet for the tiles to shed effectively.”

 USDA’s most recent Crop Progress report said Minnesota was up to 4.7 workable field days as of July 14. Corn and soybean conditions have been steady, with 58% of corn in good/excellent condition and 58% of soybeans in good/excellent condition. 

 Corn silking is at 16%, 8 percentage points behind the five-year average of 24%. Soybeans are also blooming slower than the five year average of 51%, with progress at 46% as of July 14.

 Data from the Iowa Environmental Mesonet from June 1 to June 30 shows a higher surplus of precipitation in the western half of Minnesota. The hardest hit area, according to the map, was the southern tip of Minnesota, where areas experienced upwards of 10 inches more rainfall than the average.

 Blumenthal said farmers in the state are weary of returning to drought-like conditions like those in 2023, and are hesitant for rain to stop completely. 

 But, he said, a return to “stability” would be welcome for the rest of the summer. 

 The July outlook from the National Weather Service‘s Climate Prediction Center (CPC) has Minnesota still more likely to receive more precipitation than the yearly average and neither high nor low temperatures. This is in stark contrast to most of the Corn Belt, which has experienced multiple large-scale heat waves already through the first half of the month.

 Long-term forecasts and predictions from the CPC actually have Minnesota as likely to experience above-average temperatures through the July-August-September period. Precipitation outlooks put the state as middle of the road with no clear indications of dry or wet conditions.

 A lopsided vote on the U.S. Senate Energy and Natural Resources Committee advanced a bipartisan bill Wednesday to overhaul the process to gain federal approvals for energy projects.

 The 15-4 vote demonstrated broad support for 
, though it remains unclear if Congress will take the time in an election year to move the measure to President Joe Biden’s desk.

 Members of both parties have complained that the process of gaining permits from federal agencies for energy projects is overly complicated and lengthy, delaying clean energy and fossil fuel production alike. The bill, sponsored by West Virginia independent Joe Manchin III and Wyoming Republican John Barrasso, aims to streamline the federal permitting process.

 The bill would also require lease sales for oil and gas production in the Gulf of Mexico and lift a controversial 
 on certain liquefied natural gas exports that Biden put in place in January.

 At Wednesday’s committee meeting, Manchin, who chairs the panel, said only a bipartisan effort could effectively cure the problems with energy permitting. The bill was the product of nearly two years of negotiation that included input from a wide range of interested parties, he said.

 “We’ve listened to everyone,” Manchin said. “And I think we’ve hit it right in the middle.”

 Democrats Ron Wyden of Oregon and Mazie Hirono of Hawaii, as well as independent Bernie Sanders of Vermont, who caucuses with Democrats, voted against the measure. Republican Sen. Josh Hawley of Missouri also voted no.

 Sen. Martin Heinrich of New Mexico, who is in line to be the next top Democrat on the committee after Manchin — formerly a Democrat — retires in January, supported the bill, which could give the package momentum in the next Congress if it stalls this year.

 Heinrich said that while certain provisions would increase carbon dioxide emissions, the bill’s benefits outweigh the harms.

 “This was a carefully crafted, bipartisan, balanced bill,” he said after the vote. “All of us have things we love about it. We also have a few things that we’re not crazy about, but that’s how legislation works.”

 Republican Sen. Lisa Murkowski of Alaska sounded similar notes, saying the bill lacked some elements she wanted, but was overall a positive step.

 “I think it’s important that we demonstrate some forward movement on permitting reform,” she said. “And while this isn’t the end-all and be-all, as we’ve all acknowledged, it starts moving us forward.”

 While most Democrats on the committee supported the bill, some opposed the measure based on provisions that would benefit the fossil fuel industry. Some environmental advocates also raised that objection.

 “It’s disappointing so many senators have been duped into voting for another sweetheart deal for the fossil fuel industry in exchange for meager improvements on electricity transmission,” Brett Hartl, government affairs director at the environmental group Center for Biological Diversity, wrote in a statement.

 Wyden said he supported several parts of the bill, but could not support the entire package. The bill would counteract the 2022 law Democrats passed that offered hundreds of millions of dollars in tax credits for clean energy, Wyden said.

 Wyden praised provisions to overhaul mining standards, ease permitting for transmission lines and address geothermal energy. If the bill contained only those provisions, Wyden said he would support it and “recommend a parade down Main Street.

 “Unfortunately, there are a number of provisions in this bill that run contrary to what I think the effort in 2022 was all about, the transformative efforts,” he said.

 Wyden called for continued efforts to rework the bill before it receives a vote on the Senate floor. Other members, including those who voted to approve the bill, also called for continued tweaks.

 Murkowski, a former chair of the committee, said she was disappointed the bill did not include more on hydroelectric energy.

 Manchin told Murkowski he would continue to work with her on hydro provisions.

 Members of both parties introduced a series of amendments Wednesday. Republicans largely sought additional requirements to produce fossil fuels. Democrats sought restrictions on fossil fuel production.

 Manchin led opposition to all the amendments introduced Wednesday, saying they would throw off the bill’s careful bipartisan balance.

 “I believe that we’ve identified a reasonable compromise with our bill,” he said.

 For 3 years we have been pushing the planting date on ultra early soybeans. 2022 was a great success, 2023 was a flop. So going into 2024, I had already decided if it was unsuccessful the test would be abandoned. On July 22 we harvested 49 acres of soybeans. To date this will be the biggest success of all 3 years with a yield of 87 bushels per acre. The day before, I would have sold them to anyone for 70 bushel per acre.


 Seed size was the determining factor that pushed these little, short soybeans to a respectable yield. As the combines were whacking them out, the planter was putting in a second soybean crop hopefully to be harvested by mid-November. We also have one more field with a later maturity that was planted in February also so we can figure out how much maturities matter when planted that early.


 Since harvest we have had six full days of clouds and showers, which isn’t good for anything. Our next field will be desiccated hopefully Monday. We will keep you up to date on the following second crop soybeans as time goes on.


 


 It is unreal how fast things can change. A week ago I felt like many more acres would not be harvested, and yes the mental stress was at a level I’ve rarely seen. I really didn’t think some fields could take another hot dry day then Friday night a few rains fall gave some relief. More rain within a few days caused the drought to be over and the floods came after 4 to 7 inches of rain. My goodness how the crops have turned around. Some are ugly there is no doubt about that, but we’ve got something to harvest now that the soybeans are looking good. 


 The rain was perfect for the later planted corn. With the rain going into the late third and fourth quarter we have grain to protect and build weight into. The sprayers are running and the weeds have responded just like the corn and soybeans. Fungicides and foliar fertilizer are being applied.


 I got the opportunity to step away from the farm and attend AgPhD in South Dakota. It was a blast and I am thankful for everyone I got to meet and speak with. Our next big event is the XtremeAg Field Day on my farm featuring AgroLiquid, Nachurs, Pioneer Z series trials corn varieties plots and variety fertility responses. There will also be John Deere equipment and staff to get us ready for harvest.


 


 The rains have finally relieved some of the pressure from the area. Early April corn is too far gone to help at this point. Late May corn actually has a chance to make it. Later planted corn has pollinated now and should not be as bad as early planted corn. Pollination on early planted corn is really bad due to the drought and heat. 


 Early beans are at R4 and they look like they aborted a lot of pods during the dry and hot period. It is a below average crop but at least there is a crop. About 30% of double crop soybeans were planted over due to planting in dry conditions and there was just enough moisture to swell them and then they died. Once we had a few small rains the double crop beans have now come on and they look better at the moment, but they have a lot of catching up to do.

 Colorado health officials identified two more cases of the highly pathogenic H5N1 avian influenza — bird flu — in humans over the weekend, bringing the case count in the state to seven people who worked with inflected birds.

 A worker at a northeast Colorado commercial egg layer in Weld County, where 
, was confirmed sick on Friday. On Saturday, officials identified another presumptive positive case in a worker at a separate poultry farm in Weld County.

 Another Colorado resident

 The cluster of cases, comprising eight people in Colorado, accounts for most of the bird flu cases in humans in the country.

 The recently infected workers were dealing directly with infected poultry and experienced mild symptoms such as pink eye and respiratory infection symptoms. Officials with the U.S. Department of Agriculture said last week that heat could have

 Thirteen counties in Colorado have at least one poultry flock with a bird flu outbreak, according to the

 The Colorado Department of Public Health and Environment says it is safe to eat properly handled and cooked poultry products, as the proper handling and cooking of meat and eggs kills viruses. The risk of bird flu to the general public is low and there has not been evidence of the virus spreading from person to person.

 Underground drainage tiling apparently failed and formed a sinkhole in a cornfield in northwest Iowa that allowed manure to flow into a creek, where it killed small fish for miles, according to the Iowa Department of Natural Resources.

 The manure came from Roorda Dairy, west of Paullina, which has about 4,200 dairy cattle, DNR records show. The dairy was irrigating a field with manure and didn’t notice the damaged tile line because of standing corn, said Tom Roos, a senior environmental specialist for the department.

 “With all these rain events, a tile line must have burst,” he said.

 Paullina is in O’Brien County in far northwest Iowa, parts of which have suffered severe flooding in recent weeks. The pressure from influxes of water into tile drains can cause weak areas to rupture, after which soil can flow into the tiling and create a sinkhole.

 On Wednesday, someone noticed dead fish in nearby Mud Creek and reported it to state law enforcement. A DNR investigation found that the manure had been flowing into the creek through the drainage tiling and killed fish along about nine miles of the stream, until it met another creek.

 It’s unclear how many gallons of manure might have spilled into the creek and how many fish it killed, Roos said. An investigation is ongoing.

 The dairy promptly plugged a culvert to prevent more manure from reaching the creek, Roos said. He did not know how long the spill had occurred.

 Roorda Dairy paid a $5,000 fine to the DNR in 2022 for starting construction on a manure digester without state approval. Digesters use bacteria to consume the manure and emit flammable gases, such as methane, that can be used to heat or power farm operations.

Mariah Squire," Corn conditions in North Carolina are still the worst of any top-producing state by far. The state had the greatest percentages of Very Poor and Poor corn, as well as the lowest percentages of Good and Excellent corn the week ending July 21.

 However, its combined percentage of Very Poor/Poor corn decreased for the first time since early June, indicating an overall improvement of corn condition.


 According to the most recent Crop Progress report, for the week ending July 21, the USDA rated North Carolina’s corn as follows: 31% Very Poor, 35% Poor, 19% Fair, 14% Good, and 1% Excellent. That compares with ratings from the week prior: 44% Very Poor, 29% Poor, 18% Fair, 9% Good, and 0% Excellent.


 Recent more favorable weather has played a role in the improvement, according to Kathie Dello, North Carolina’s state climatologist and the director of the North Carolina State Climate Office. “We’ve been lucky to return to a cooler, more showery weather pattern for the second half of July — bringing some much needed relief to our producers,” Dello says.


 Other North Carolina crops also showed some improvement.


 
For the week ending July 21, the USDA rated North Carolina soybeans as follows: 5% Very Poor, 16% Poor, 34% Fair, 40% Good, and 5% Excellent. That’s much improved compared with the week ending July 14. At that point, soybeans were rated 7% Very Poor, 24% Poor, 43% Fair, 26% Good, and 0% Excellent. 


 
For the week ending July 21, the USDA rated North Carolina peanuts as follows: 3% Very Poor, 4% Poor, 32% Fair, 54% Good, and 7% Excellent. The week prior, ending July 14, a combined total of 12% of the peanut crop were rated Very Poor/Poor. Only 46% were rated Good, and and 4% were rated Excellent. 


 
 For the week ending July 21, the USDA rated pasture and range for the state as follows: 6% Very Poor, 18% Poor, 59% Fair, 16% Good, and 1% Excellent. Those conditions are far better than the week ending July 14. At that point they were rated 12% Very Poor, 43% Poor, 32% Fair, 13% Good, and 0% Excellent.


 Thomas Shaw raises flue-cured tobacco, corn, soybeans, and wheat in north-central Vance County, by the Virginia border. Shaw explained why he described his corn as “severely damaged.”

 “In June, we had extreme drought and temperatures here and that really damaged our corn.” Shaw said. He added that although a rainy July helped some of the corn recover, the overall condition remains “very poor,” and he says he doesn’t have high hopes for much of a yield. 


 The weather also has adversely affected Shaw’s soybeans, especially his double crop behind wheat. Hot, dry weather was an issue even before June: In April it delayed planting. “The first planted beans are starting to bloom, but they don’t have much size [at] all to them,” Shaw says. He added that the soybean canopies are not forming, as they should be. Like corn, he does not expect much yield.


 While June was hot and dry, July has seen excessive rain. “We went from one extreme to the other,” he said. It’s now affecting the ability to spray for weeds.


 Shaw says he’s hopeful some of his soybeans can recover. However, he knows sufficient rain and suitable temperatures were lacking during a critical window for corn. “Corn, you know,” he says, “that doesn’t come back.”


 David Hight raises tobacco, peppers, corn, soybeans, and wheat in Warren County, northeast of Raleigh by the Virginia state line. He described his corn to be “in terrible shape.” The poor weather’s timing exacerbated the effect.

 “The hottest and driest point of the year was during pollination, and a lot of our corn didn’t pollinate,” he says. He explains that his crops got very little rain from May 20 until July 4. In one location he measured during that period, the total precipitation was 0.60 inches. With that and temperatures of 90°F to 100°F almost every day, the weather absolutely took a toll, he says, especially on corn.


 Like Shaw, Hight says dry weather through April negatively affected planting, and additional dryness since then even forced some replanting. “These beans [have] a long way to go,” he says. 


 Also like Shaw, Hight says his crops have received some much needed rain in July — but almost too much. “We’ve been getting good rain, actually to the point we really need it to slow down a little bit,” he says. But, “We really can’t get work done because of it.”


 Hight says this year’s conditions remind him of 2010, except that year provided no respite by rain, as this July has. He went on to say that last month ranks as one of the driest Junes he’s seen in his lifetime.

 Federal health officials are encouraging farm workers who tend livestock and poultry to get vaccinated for seasonal influenza to help prevent a bird flu mutation that might spark a pandemic in people.

 The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention said Tuesday it would devote up to $5 million to pay for the vaccinations, and that it will rely on states to implement the initiative.

 There are 14 known human infections of highly pathogenic avian influenza that resulted from contact with infected dairy cattle and poultry in the United States, and all but one has happened in the past four months.

 The virus has been circulated by wild birds for more than two years and has sporadically transmitted to domestic birds. A variation of the virus has been infecting U.S. dairy cattle since December, and four people who worked closely with infected cattle also became ill.

 In recent weeks, nine people in Colorado who were tasked with culling infected poultry contracted the virus.

 The CDC has maintained that the virus’ risk to humans is low — those who have been infected so far had minor symptoms of respiratory illness or pinkeye, or both.

 It has not been shown to transmit between people, but the virus has the potential to rapidly gain that ability if it infects someone who also has a seasonal flu virus.

 “Such dual infections, while rare, could potentially result in an exchange of genetic material between two different influenza viruses,” Nirav Shah, principal deputy director for the CDC, said in a call with reporters Tuesday.

 Shah said that “reassortment” process could pose a “significant public health concern” if bird flu gains the ability to spread person-to-person the way seasonal flu does, potentially resulting in a virus that spreads easily and causes severe symptoms.

 Shah said the CDC will devote up to $10 million for farm workers’ health related to avian flu. Half will be spent educating and training farm workers about how to avoid being infected.

 The other half will pay for seasonal flu vaccines for an estimated 200,000 farm workers who tend livestock and poultry. The CDC hopes to vaccinate all of them but acknowledges that less than half of the general population typically gets a flu shot.

 How the voluntary vaccination effort will proceed is unclear. State health officials are expected to implement them, most immediately in the 13 states that have confirmed infections among cows.

 That includes Iowa, where 13 dairy herds have been infected. However, no new infections have been reported in the state in the past month.

 A spokesperson for the Iowa Department of Health and Human Services — which presumably would coordinate with the CDC — did not immediately respond to a request to comment for this article.

 The vaccine will not protect the workers from contracting bird flu, Shah said, nor will it guarantee they won’t be infected by seasonal flu. But he said it’s an important component of the public health response to the new virus’ threat.

 “The risk here is a theoretical but important risk,” Shah said.

 The confirmations of new bird flu infections among cattle have waned significantly in most states, except for in Colorado. In the past 30 days, two-thirds of the nation’s 32 newly infected herds were in that state, according to U.S. Department of Agriculture data.

 Some of that might be due to Colorado’s 
, but it’s also “a quirk of history and geography,” said Eric Deeble, deputy under secretary for marketing and regulatory programs for the USDA.

 The state has far fewer dairy farms than the leading milk-producing states, but most of them are concentrated in one county.

 “They are all in very close proximity to one another, and so there is a lot of sharing of equipment, a lot of sharing of personnel and a lot of movement on and off farms to adjacent farms,” Deeble said.

 The USDA has identified the movement of equipment and people between dairy farms as a primary vector for virus transmissions from herd to herd and from herd to flock.

 The virus has been identified in 172 dairy herds in the United States this year. Fifty of them are in Colorado. In Texas, where the infections originated, the virus was confirmed in 22 herds, although there were many that went untested because they recovered before bird flu 
 as the culprit.

 Current levels of futures contracts suggest that appropriate budgeting prices for 2024 crops production are $4.00 per bushel for corn and $10.50 per bushel for soybeans.

 Those prices would result in low returns in 2024, far lower than the last low-price period from 2014 to 2019. Much higher costs cause lower 2024 returns. Those budget price forecasts could change with unforeseen events, as does occur in agriculture. Over the next several months, estimates for returns and incomes will solidify. Still, it seems prudent to plan for much lower prices.

 Expectations generally have been for much lower corn and soybeans prices in 2024 compared with the 2021 to 2023. In February, the projected price used to set guarantees on crop insurance was set at $4.66 per bushel for corn. The projected price is the average of February settlement prices of the December corn traded on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange (CME) and represents an unbiased indicator of prices at harvest. The $4.66 projected price is well below the $5.90 projected price for 2022 and $5.91 for 2023.

 Since February, the December CME futures contract has fallen, currently trading near $4.10 per bushel (see Figure 1). This decline in price is consistent with a growing belief that yields in the U.S. will be above trend. Moreover, no significant market surprises have occurred that would either reduce supply or increase demand. In other words, a good supply of corn and roughly stable demand are leading to lowered price expectations.

 The current December futures price for corn is consistent with cash prices below $4.00 at harvest, roughly $3.80 per bushel. Given usual price patterns, one expects cash prices to increase over the marketing season, and an average cash price of $4.00 per bushel for 2024 production seems reasonable.

 A $4.00 price is well below recent prices. USDA reports the national market year average (MYA) price at $6.00 for 2021 and $6.54 for 2022. The 2023 marketing year will end in August, with a current forecast of $4.65 per bushel. If a $4.00 price occurs for 2024, it would be the lowest since 2019, when the market year average price was $3.56 per bushel.

 Futures markets are currently suggesting roughly similar prices for 2025 for corn. The December 2025 futures contract is trading near $4.60, indicating that cash corn prices at harvest in 2025 could be in the low $4.30 range.

 A similar story exists for soybeans. The 2024 projected price for soybeans is $11.55 per bushel, well below projected prices in 2022 ($14.33) and 2023 ($13.76). November futures prices have fallen since February, now trading near $10.20 per bushel. Cash price at harvest below $10 per bushel are likely, with an overall 2024 MYA price of $10.50 being an appropriate projection. Futures prices suggest continuing low prices into 2025, with a $10.80 price being an appropriate projection for the 2025 MYA price.

 Current markets are pointing to corn prices averaging near $4.00 per bushel and soybeans prices averaging near $10.50 per bushel over the next several years. Overall, the higher prices from 2021 through 2023 appear transitory, and prices are now moving to lower levels (see 
, 
). We may be again entering a period of lower prices like that from 2014 through 2019. From 2014 to 2019, central Illinois farmers received an average price of $3.64 per bushel for corn and $9.69 for soybeans.

 Current market price indicators of $4.00 per bushel for corn and $10.50 for soybeans are above the 2014 to 2019 averages. Still, return levels likely will be much lower than from 2014 to 2019 because of higher costs. According to Illinois Farm Business Farm Management (FBFM) data, non-land costs for corn averaged $587 per acre from 2014 to 2019 (see Revenue and Costs for Illinois Grain Corps 
). Those non-land costs increased to a projected $772 per acre, an increase of $185 per acre. Non-land costs for soybeans increased from an average of $363 per acre in 2014 to 2019 to a projected $512 per acre in 2024, an increase of $149 per acre. Cash rents increased from an average of $277 per acre from 2014 to 2019 to a projected $359 per acre in 2024, an increase of $82 per acre.

 We revised prices and yields in the central Illinois high-productivity budgets (see 
, 
) to reflect lower prices, higher yields, and some Price Loss Coverage (PLC) and Agriculture Risk Coverage (ARC) payments. Corn prices were lowered from $4.50 per bushel to $4.00 per bushel (see Table 1). Growing conditions have been good across Illinois, leading to an increase in yield from 227 bushels per acre to 234 bushels per acre. Soybean prices are reduced from $11.30 per bushel to $10.50 per bushel, while yields are increased from 72 bushels per acre to 75 bushels per acre. Also included are $5 of PLC/ARC payments. If those payments occur, they will be received in October 2025. Based on current crop conditions, crop insurance payments likely will be minimal in 2024. We also added $5 per acre to reflect modest crop insurance payments. On revenue products, lower prices likely will be offset by higher yields.

 Those changes cause farmer returns from cash rent farmland to decrease. For corn, farmer return decreases from -$100 per acre to -$185 per acre. Soybean returns decrease from -$57 per acre to -$74 per acre. Most of central Illinois is in a 50% corn and 50% soybean rotation, leading to an overall net farmer return of -$129 per acre on cash rented land.

 A -$129 per acre return would be the lowest since comparable records began in 2000. Over the entire 2000 to 2023 period, farmland returns averaged $90 per acre, but there is a great deal of variability across years. High return periods occurred

 Negative returns occurred after both high-price periods. Returns were -$3 in 2013 and -$10 in 2015. The 2014 projected returns are more negative at -$129 per acre.

 Some unanticipated events could increase prices, as happens in agriculture. As a reminder of possibilities, corn prices were approaching $3.00 per bushel in the summer of 2020, the beginning of the COVID pandemic. Then, a Derecho storm hit central Iowa in August, extending into northern Illinois, taking the top end off of U.S. yields. It also became evident that the China swine herd was being rebuilt after being severely impacted by African Swine Fever. Those two events began a period of higher prices, which were further fueled by the Ukraine-Russia conflict and lackluster yields across the world. Something similar could happen in late 2024, but those events are difficult to anticipate and seem unlikely.

 The federal government could institute an ad hoc disaster assistance program. A continuation of the Economic Relief Program (ERP) seems likely, given its prevalence in recent years (see 
, 
). Essentially, ERP offers a top-up of the coverage level of crop insurance. However, those programs likely will not fill the gap. Like crop insurance, ERP protects against within-year declines in revenue. One of the income issues now is the decline in price over the years. For example, the projected cost for corn fell from $5.91 to $4.66. An extension of the ERP program will do nothing to cover this $1.25 fall in price. An alternative ad hoc disaster assistance program could arise. It is, after all, an election year.

 Budgeting for $4.00 corn and $10.50 soybean prices seems appropriate for 2024. Slightly higher price expectations – $4.30 for corn and $10.80 for soybeans – are accurate estimates of market-driven estimates for 2025. Using these prices will result in negative returns for most cash-rented farms. Depending on a farm’s debt position, owned farmland could still provide positive cash flows. Returns and farm income will come into clearer focus in the next several months.

 Most farm operations have strong financial positions, with relatively low debt and high working capital (see 
, 
, 
, 
, and 
). However, the low returns that are expected will quickly erode that position, particularly the working capital position. Some farms may need to make changes to their operations to avoid severe losses of liquidity.

 The price and return outlook suggest downward adjustments in cash rental rates. However, cash rents typically have lags in moving downward when prices fall. Still, the severity of income declines may dictate that cash rents will come down for specific tracts, particularly it the farms operating those tracts currently have lower working capital levels.

 Some have suggested that farming is a boom to bust business. Long periods of low incomes like those from 2014 to 2019 need to be survived to gain financial resources from higher price and income periods like those in 2021 and 2022. We may have now entered another extended period of low prices again. Time will tell.

Tony Dreibus," Corn and soybean futures were modestly lower in overnight trading as rainfall in the northern and central Midwest offset concerns about extremely hot weather in the South. 

 Rain fell in parts of Nebraska, Iowa, and Illinois throughout the week and more precipitation is expected. 

 More showers and storms are expected today in parts of Illinois, Indiana, Kentucky, and southwestern Ohio, the National Weather Service said in a statement this morning. 

 Iowa is free of dry or drought conditions and less than 3% of Illinois is seeing abnormally dry weather, according to the U.S. Drought Monitor, which is scheduled to update its maps today. 

 Underpinning prices, however, are concerns about the severity and frequency of thunderstorms that have rolled through parts of the Midwest in recent days. 

 More severe weather, including intense downpours and flash flooding, is possible with today’s storms, the agency said. 

 “Many of these locations have seen recent heavy rainfall given repeated rounds of organized storms passing through, leading to wetter antecedent conditions more sensitive to additional rainfall,” NWS said. 

 Corn futures for December delivery fell 1¼¢ to $3.98½ a bushel overnight on the Chicago Board of Trade.

 Soybean futures for November delivery lost 2¾¢ to $10.19¾ a bushel. Soymeal gained 60¢ to $316.30 a short ton and soy oil was down 0.34¢ to 41.98¢ a pound. 

 Wheat futures for September delivery gained 2¾¢ to $5.30 a bushel, while Kansas City futures rose 1¾¢ to $5.50¾ a bushel. 

 Ethanol output surged to a record high in the week that ended on July 26, according to the Energy Information Administration.

 Production of the corn-based biofuel improved to an average of 1.109 million barrels a day, the agency said in a report. That’s up from 1.095 million barrels the previous week and the highest level on record. 

 In the Midwest, by far the biggest producing region, output increased to 1.045 million barrels per day, on average, from 1.035 million a week earlier. 

 Gulf Coast production rose to 29,000 barrels from 26,000 a week earlier, EIA said. 

 Rocky Mountain output was reported at 13,000 barrels a day from 12,000 barrels the week prior, and West Coast production improved to 10,000 barrels from 9,000 barrels, the agency said.

 East Coast was again unchanged at 12,000 barrels per day. 

 USDA said in a report last month that it expects ethanol makers to use 5.45 billion bushels of corn for ethanol production in the 2024/2025 marketing year that starts on Sept. 1. If realized that would be unchanged from the current year, but up from the 5.176 billion bushels used in the 2022/2023 marketing year. 

 Ethanol inventories in the week through July 26 increased to 23.973 million barrels, the government said. 

 That’s up from 23.723 million a week earlier and the highest level for stockpiles since the week that ended on May 17, EIA said in its report. 

 Flood warnings and watches have been issued for counties in southeastern Iowa as rain continues to fall in the area, according to the National Weather Service. 

 “Excessive runoff may result in flooding of rivers, creeks, streams and other low-lying and flood-prone locations,” the agency said. “Creeks and streams may rise out of their banks.” 

 Soils are saturated from precipitation yesterday and more storms are on the way, NWS said. 

 Heat warnings and advisories will again take effect today for much of the southern Midwest and the Delta. 

 In southern Missouri and Illinois, heat indexes this afternoon are forecast to hit as high as 110° Fahrenheit, the agency said. 

 Values in northern Arkansas will likely hit 112°, NWS said.

Chuck Abbott," After three years of study, the 
 proposed limits on salmonella contamination of raw chicken and turkey products on Monday with an emphasis on the types of salmonella bacteria mostly likely to cause illness. Consumer groups said the proposal, modeled on a 1994 USDA ban on the most dangerous types of E. coli bacteria in ground beef, was a large step forward for public health.

 “The proposal is one of the greatest advances in food safety in a generation,” said the 
. The 
 said the USDA proposal “sets safety standards where they matter to consumers; on poultry products themselves rather than on the establishments that process the birds.” The current safety system calls for processors to implement plans to avoid the contamination of poultry meat in the plant but allows sale of products containing salmonella.

 Contaminated food is the number one cause of salmonella infections in the United States, and poultry is one of the leading sources of food-borne salmonella illnesses. Although the presence of salmonella bacteria in poultry products has been declining, there has been no reduction in salmonella illnesses, said the USDA. It estimates there are 125,000 cases of salmonella illnesses related to chicken and nearly 43,000 illnesses related to turkey annually.

 “This proposed framework is a systemic approach to addressing salmonella contamination at poultry slaughter and processing, which includes enforceable standards that will result in safer food for consumers and fewer illnesses,” said Agriculture Secretary Tom Vilsack. “Far too many consumers become sick from poultry contaminated with salmonella, and today’s announcement marks a historic step forward to combat this threat.”

 Under the USDA proposal, raw whole chickens, chicken parts, ground chicken, and ground turkey products would be barred from sale if they contain 10 or more colony forming units per gram of salmonella bacteria and any amount of three disease-causing salmonella serotypes apiece for chicken and turkey.

 Poultry processors also would be required to develop a microbial monitoring program to prevent pathogen contamination during slaughter.

 Trade groups for the broiler chicken and turkey industries questioned the scientific basis for the USDA regulation and warned it might drive up costs.

 “We support changes in food safety regulations that are based on sound science, robust data, and are demonstrated to positively impact public health. We are concerned this proposal is not based on any of those,” said Ashley Peterson, in charge of regulatory affairs at the National Chicken Council, a trade group. “It also has the potential to significantly raise the price of chicken at a time when Americans are dealing with inflation in every part of their lives.”

 The 
 said USDA’s meat safety agency, the Food Safety and Inspection Service, already had the power “to drive improvements in food safety without implementing a final product standard for salmonella in turkey products.”

 In April, the USDA issued a regulation, with a one-year grace period, that would reject raw chicken as an ingredient in 
 if it contained too much salmonella. It was the first USDA rule to name salmonella as an adulterant in a class of raw poultry products.

 Americans are forecast to consume 117.1 pounds of chicken and turkey meat per person this year, slightly more than the amount of red meats they are forecasted to consume, which includes 58.2 pounds of beef and 51 pounds of pork.

 In his acceptance speech at the Republican National Convention late last week, former President Donald Trump made no direct mention of agriculture. But he touched on a number of issues — electric vehicles, clean energy, and trade — that directly affect the agriculture industry.

 “Trump started the rambling 1½-hour speech on a unifying note and by recounting, for the first time in public, how he escaped assassination on Saturday in Butler, Pennsylvania,” 
 late last week. “… But Trump eventually pivoted into long riffs on his priority issues, including trade, energy, and immigration.”

 Trump made perhaps his strongest remarks when it came to electric vehicles, with 
 that “former President Donald Trump used his nomination speech to take aim at President Joe Biden’s electric vehicle policies, vowing to action against them on his first day in office.”

 “ ‘I will end the electric vehicle mandate on day one,’ Trump said in his address at the Republican National Convention in Milwaukee. The move would result in ‘saving the U.S. auto industry from complete obliteration, which is happening right now, and saving U.S. customers thousands and thousands of dollars per car,’ he said,” Natter reported. “While the Biden administration doesn’t have a mandate on electric vehicles, critics of new air pollution limits issued by the Environmental Protection Agency in March have said they would illegally force automakers to sell EVs.”

 
 late last week that “corn growers and ethanol producers fear the emission standards will depress demand for ethanol-blended gasoline, although it’s not clear how much and how fast the reduction in demand would be. At the same time, the biofuel industry is looking to preserve tax incentives created by the IRA to subsidize production of sustainable aviation fuel.”

 Natter reported that “Trump’s remarks on EVs came just moments before he criticized what he said was trillions of dollars of wasteful spending ‘having to do with the green new scam.’ He said he would instead direct the money to projects like roads, bridges and dams, though it wasn’t immediately clear how he would make good on the pledge.”

 Brasher reported that the “green new scam” “was an apparent reference to the Inflation Reduction Act enacted in 2022. The IRA, which included funding for farm bill conservation programs, was estimated to cost well under $1 trillion. But Trump promised to somehow redirect clean energy funding to infrastructure projects. ‘We will not allow it to be spent on Green New Scam ideas,’ Trump said,” according to Brasher’s reporting.

 
 that “Trump didn’t directly talk about his pledge to impose across-the-board tariffs on imported products and duties of up to 60% on China. But he promised to bring more auto manufacturing to the United States, threatening to impose tariffs of 100% to 200% on foreign-made autos. ‘They will be unsellable in the United States,’ he said.”

 “He also touted his administration’s trade record,” Brasher reported. “ ‘We have long been taken advantage of by other countries, and think of it, oftentimes these other countries are considered so-called allies,’ Trump said. ‘We lose jobs, we lose revenue, and they gain everything, and wipe out our businesses, wipe out our people. I stopped it for four years, I stopped it.’ ”

 “He also mentioned the U.S.-Mexico-Canada trade agreement that replaced the North American Free Trade Agreement, which Trump called the ‘worst trade deal ever made,’ ” Brasher reported.

 Trump’s comments on trade followed a speech from his pick for vice president, Sen. J.D. Vance of Ohio, who “blames increased trade with China, Mexico and other low-wage countries for job losses that have devastated manufacturing communities in the industrial Rust Belt, including his home state of Ohio,”

Mariah Squire," Brook Duer is a staff attorney at the Penn State Center for Agricultural and Shale Law. Starting in private practice in Lancaster County and representing clients in agriculture, he made his way to the Pennsylvania Department of Agriculture, where he was chief counsel for most of his tenure.


 Duer spoke with Successful Farming
 magazine about what drew him into the law field, how he gained an impressive understanding of HPAI and related regulations during the 2014–15 outbreak, and some advice for farmers during the current outbreak. 


 BD: I decided to go to law school because I was, believe it or not, in a rock and roll band, and the manager of the band was in law school himself. He kind of talked me into it. I went to the University of Pittsburgh Law School, and then when I got out, I was looking to get away from the city. Lancaster County in Pennsylvania [west of Philadelphia] had an opening. 

 I got into private practice, and you can’t really be in a town like this without representing agriculture clientele in various forms. I really enjoyed understanding a bit more about how people make a living in this industry and all of the moving parts. 


 Around 2007 I went up to the Department of Agriculture, and I became the chief counsel there in short order. I worked there for 12 years, and eight of those years I was the chief counsel. 


 It was such a great education. If I had known the interesting aspects of being an in-house attorney for an agricultural regulator, I probably would’ve done it a lot earlier. That was just an eye-opening experience, a great 12 years.


 When you’re outside of government, you don’t always see how hard some people work at it and how much they put into it. That really did kind of turn my head around, you know? This is a worthwhile endeavor, from the government standpoint, to try to make these programs work better, try to make things happen in the best possible way for farmers and other agriculture stakeholders.


 I came in from the outside, not being a longtime government lawyer. Luckily, when I got there, I had a good staff who had experience. I just picked up everything I could from these people. 


 When you’re in private practice, people expect you to get a result. That’s what they’re paying you for. I think that was something I brought from the outside. In government I tried to just apply the same thing, which is, if they brought me into this, then they expect me to achieve something.


 BD: In Pennsylvania at that time, we were obviously concerned about the spread east, toward us. Like most of the Mid-Atlantic portion of the country, we have very high numbers in terms of poultry production, so we were watching very intently. 


 Everybody was doing the same thing, which was learning how USDA was handling all of the big questions, whether it was how do you dispose of carcasses or how you do the depopulation — what’s working, what’s not working. We were also very intently watching the relationship of USDA with farmers.


 We were very intent on trying to make sure that this went well, if it ever happened here. We used to have a lot of these tabletop exercises where we would do simulations and start to learn the processes. 


 When you are in agriculture, you understand the major animal diseases. You understand on paper what these are, but you don’t necessarily have firsthand experience with them. Very few people do. But the 2014–15 outbreak gave some people firsthand experience, and it gave others a chance to watch that. It certainly improved everybody’s understanding of what you do, and it improved the USDA’s and [the agency's Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service] operations immensely.


 In the federal system, animal disease control is a highly technical little niche. Animal disease control, when you work at the state level, is much more visible, and the gravity of it, I think, becomes more real. If this part of your state department of agriculture doesn’t work well or doesn’t have the resources to function at its ideal capacity in times of crisis, then that’s not a good situation for the state.


 BD: Absolutely nothing, to be honest with you. I remember walking in, and the gentleman who was the chief counsel before me gave me some orientation to a few things. He handed me this avian influenza pandemic emergency plan. I had this vague memory of avian influenza having some ability to cross over to people, but I really didn’t have any kind of firm foundation and understanding. I really opened the books and started understanding what was going on in 2014. I was there from 2007 to 2014 before I really had to get into it.


 I was always fascinated by the amount of authority that was given to the state veterinarians and the animal health personnel under our state law to do things immediately by orders. Quarantine orders can be quite expansive and burdensome, so it’s quite interesting to watch that kind of authority be used judiciously. 


 You watch the level of expertise from the regulatory people, veterinarians, and others — you get a new respect for the depth of their knowledge. It takes many minds to put together these quarantine orders. 


 When you first get into government as a lawyer, you want to live a bit by the premise of “Why do you do it that way?” It’s good to push your people to examine why something is done a certain way, and “Just because we always did it that way” isn’t the answer. You have to think further than that. 


 But then, on the other hand, you gain a new respect for why it’s done that way. When you start getting into things as drastic as quarantine orders, you start to realize that because it’s always been done that way — has history to it — it’s a history worth figuring out before you change it. 


 In the course of all of these HPAI measures that are being taken, we have not had any standoffs where people aren’t letting the USDA officials in or they aren’t listening. I’m amazed at how civil this has been done — the quarantine orders and other measures — since 2014. There’s been cooperation. Rationality has won out in the execution of these disease control measures, which is something to be very thankful for. 


 
BD: Your animal health veterinarian staff, whether it’s your state staff, or your USDA staff in this particular instance, are some of your greatest assets. Gain as much knowledge from these people as you can while you’re around them, because it’ll help you think about the problems better in the future. 


 Try to look at their perspective and understand why things are the way they are, and then have a discussion about it. Learning from all of these professionals that are in this field and have been in this field for a long time is so key to this.

 that “record-high wheat yields in North Dakota are set to further expand American grain supplies and should help to quell inflation for foods like bagels, where prices had recently started rising again.”

 “Dozens of wheat traders, millers and bakers fanned out across the state in an annual crop tour this week,” Hirtzer reported. “They found lush wheat fields — thick with tall, green plants. Farmers enjoyed a speedy spring sowing season and ample rainfall in May and June, before a recent turn to hot and dry weather.”

 “The primary variety grown in the state of hard red spring wheat should yield 54.5 bushels per acre, according to the tour’s final data Thursday,” Hirtzer reported. “That’s up 15% from last year and just below the US Department of Agriculture’s projection earlier this month of 56 bushels per acre — the highest ever. The tour estimate would also mean the state’s highest yield ever.”

 
 that “U.S. all-wheat production for 2024/25 is forecast at 2,008 million bushels, the largest wheat crop since 2016/17. Production is up 134 million bushels from the previous month and 11 percent higher than the previous year.”

 “Larger production for Hard Red Winter (HRW) and Hard Red Spring (HRS) are the major factors driving the year-to-year increase in total wheat production, while smaller increases are seen for White and Durum. Soft Red Winter (SRW) is down from the previous year’s bumper crop,” Sowell wrote. “Stronger U.S. supplies this year are expected to make U.S. wheat more competitive on the global market, contributing to higher exports. Total U.S. exports are forecast at 825 million bushels, the largest since 2020/21.”

 
 that “the Wheat Quality Council’s Hard Winter Wheat Tour concluded Thursday, May 16, in Manhattan, Kansas. After three days, scouting 449 fields across the state and some into neighboring Nebraska and Oklahoma, the total weighted average yield for hard winter wheat was estimated at 46.5 bushels per acre (bpa), a 55% increase from 2023.”

 “Last year, the average yield estimate for the 2023 winter wheat tour was 30.0 bpa,” Jenkins reported. “Based on May 1 conditions, Kansas’s 2024 winter wheat crop is forecast at 268 million bushels, up 33% from last year’s crop, according to USDA National Agricultural Statistics Service. Average yield is forecast at 38.0 bpa, up 3 bushels from last year.”

 
 that “plentiful US supplies have benchmark Chicago futures trading near the lowest levels since 2020. Bigger stockpiles and cheaper grain are welcomed by food manufacturers who had been struggling with years of reduced US plantings and the record-high prices that followed Russia’s invasion of Ukraine in 2022. Just a year ago, wheat was coming to the US from Poland to make up for a shortfall.”

 “Still, prices for foods made from the staple grain are still relatively expensive. Earlier in July, the US Labor Department said its food index climbed amid gains in the baked-goods category even as broader inflation pressures were easing,” Hirtzer reported. “Wheat growers are also facing lower farm-gate prices even as costs for seeds, chemicals and equipment have stayed high.”

Tony Dreibus," Soybean futures plunged in overnight trading on predicted favorable weather in the Midwest. 

 National Weather Service maps forecast rain during the next seven days for parts of the region, including much of Iowa and Illinois, the largest U.S. corn and bean producers. Additionally, much of the eastern Corn Belt is projected to see rainfall during the next week. 

 Showers are expected to ease some dry areas in the western Midwest, and weather forecasts look wetter for parts of the eastern Midwest, Commodity Weather Group said in a note to clients.

 Precipitation will boost soybeans and cotton in the Delta, the forecaster said. 

 Sixty-eight percent of the U.S. soybean crop were in Good or Excellent condition last week, according to the USDA. Fifty-seven percent of the corn crop earned top ratings. 

 The USDA is scheduled to release its weekly crop progress report this afternoon. 

 The weather has been favorable in parts of the Midwest this growing season. Iowa is free of drought and abnormally dry conditions, according to the U.S. Drought Monitor. At the start of the year, 97% of Iowa were facing dry or drought conditions. 

 Only 2.3% of Illinois are seeing abnormally dry conditions vs. 12% at the start of the calendar year, the monitor said. 

 Soybean futures for November delivery fell 16½¢ to $10.32 a bushel overnight on the Chicago Board of Trade (CBOT). Soy meal lost $5 to $319.70 a short ton, and soy oil was down 0.31¢, to 41.52¢ a pound. 

 Corn futures for December delivery dropped 1½¢ to $4.08½ a bushel.

 Wheat futures for September delivery lost 3½¢ to $5.20 a bushel, while Kansas City futures gained 2¢ to $5.47½ a bushel. 

 Investors reduced their net-short positions, or bets on lower prices, in corn and beans in the seven days that ended July 23, according to data from the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC).

 Speculators held a short position of 333,885 futures contracts in corn, down from 352,772 contracts a week earlier, the government agency said. That’s the smallest bearish position since June 25. 

 Money managers were net-short by 172,945 soybean futures contracts last week, down from 183,145 contracts seven days prior, the CFTC said. 

 In wheat, hedge funds and other large investment firms held a net-short position of 73,159 in soft-red winter futures, up narrowly from 72,831 contracts. Speculators also held a net-41,016 hard-red winter contracts, down modestly from 44,624 contracts a week earlier, the agency said.

The report provides positions held by commercial traders, or those using futures to hedge their physical assets; noncommercial traders, or money managers (also called large speculators); and nonreportables, or small speculators.

 A net-long position indicates more traders are betting on higher prices, while a net-short position means more are betting futures to decline.

 Extremely hot weather is expected for a large chunk of the Corn Belt. Red flag and excessive heat warnings have been issued from the Texas panhandle east into southern Indiana, National Weather Service maps show.

Mariah Squire," According to USDA’s most recent Crop Progress report, all of the country’s top corn-producing states now have at least some percentage of corn that has reached the dough stage. Five of those states are ahead of their respective five-year averages by at least 10 percentage points and up to 21 percentage points. 


 According to USDA, 62% of Missouri’s corn crop had reached the dough stage the week ending July 28. Last year at this time, only 51% of the crop was at the dough stage. What’s more, the five-year average is 41% – that’s 21 percentage points lower than the current percentage of dough-stage corn. 


 In terms of good-to-excellent corn, 78% of Missouri’s corn falls in this category, ranking second of top-producing states (behind Pennsylvania). The state also ranked second for the most corn rated excellent (behind Nebraska). Overall, Missouri’s corn rated 4% very poor, 4% poor, 14% fair, 58% good, and 20% excellent.


 Favorable weather and soil moisture levels undoubtedly played a role in the progress and condition of Missouri’s corn. According to USDA, the average temperature statewide was 76.5°F, which was 1°F below normal, and soil moisture levels were mostly adequate. USDA rated topsoil moisture supply 1% very short, 10% short, 84% adequate, and 5% surplus and subsoil moisture supply 0% very short, 6% short, 92% percent adequate, and 2% surplus.


 USDA said that 37% of Nebraska’s corn crop had reached the dough stage the week ending July 28. That’s a jump of 19 percentage points and 17 percentage points compared to last year at this time and the five-year average, respectively.


 At 27%, Nebraska had the most corn rated excellent of the country’s top producers. The breakdown of condition ratings by USDA for the state is as follows: 3% very poor, 7% poor, 16% fair, 47% good, and 27% excellent.


 Travis Gustafson, an Agronomic Service Representative for Syngenta Crop Protection covering central and western Nebraska, described sustained high temperatures that are not taking as much of a toll on crops as they could. He explained the following for the week ending July 28: “Average highs were in the 90’s with this pattern forecasted to continue for the next seven to 10 days. While it is hot, it is not unprecedented for this time of year. The early season rains we had in Nebraska helped to build the subsoil moisture profile back up from the drought conditions we had last year and the crop does not seem to be showing signs of stress despite the high temperatures.”


 In the Buckeye State, 25% of the corn crop had reached the dough stage, USDA said Monday. That’s quite a surge compared to a five-year average of 9%, and even more striking compared to the percentage of corn at the dough stage last year at this time: only 2%.


 Ohio’s corn was rated by USDA as follows: 1% very poor, 4% poor, 29% fair, 55% good, and 11% excellent.


 Despite great progress and condition numbers, Ohio’s recent weather is causing some concern. The most recent U.S. Drought Monitor report showed that nearly 70% of the state was abnormally dry or worse as of July 23. State Statistician Ben Torrance said that the dry conditions were beginning to worry farmers; that’s according to the USDA NASS Ohio Crop Weather report released July 29. 


 As of July 28, 48% of the corn crop in Kansas had reached the dough stage. That’s 16 percentage points ahead of the five-year average. It’s also an increase of 18 percentage points since the week prior and 13 percentage points compared to last year at this time.


 As for corn conditions, only about half of Kansas’ corn was in good or excellent shape as of July 28. USDA rated 5% of the state’s corn very poor, 12% poor, 31% fair, 40% good, and 12% excellent.


 According to USDA, 34% of Iowa’s corn crop had reached the dough stage as of July 28. Although that’s only 2 percentage points up from where the state’s crop was last year at this time, it’s 10 percentage points ahead of the five-year average. 


 Iowa’s corn is largely in good shape, with only 4% rating very poor or poor. The specific condition breakdown for the state is as follows: 1% very poor, 3% poor, 19% fair, 58% good, and 19% excellent.

 All parts of Iowa — for the first time in more than four years — have sufficient soil moisture to not be considered “abnormally dry” by national climate experts, according to a U.S. Drought Monitor report on Thursday.

 That dryness designation can indicate an area is on the cusp of drought conditions, under which affected areas can have negative impacts for agriculture and water supplies.

 An example: After years of drought, a lake that supplies water for the city of Osceola had lost so much of its volume that the city considered 
. Significant rainfall in recent months has restored the lake to nearly its normal surface elevation, according to city data.

 Drought developed in Iowa in July 2020 and persisted 
, after the state had one of its wettest starts to a year on record. It marked a dramatic recovery since September, when the state was the driest it had been in a decade.

 Last week, Iowa had rainfall that was below average, according to State Climatologist Justin Glisan. However, heavy rain fell along the eastern edge of the state, where the last remaining pocket of abnormal dryness lay.

 A month ago, about 31% of the state was abnormally dry, according to Drought Monitor reports. The last time there was no drought or dryness was May 2020.

 The federal Climate Prediction Center does not foresee drought re-emerging in Iowa in the coming months. Iowa lies in the center of a multistate area that has no drought and little abnormal dryness.

 The USDA reported this week that more than 90% of Iowa’s farm fields have adequate or surplus moisture for growing crops. Last year, only 57% of topsoil was rated the same way.

 

","Updated on July 19, 2024",agriculture,Climate experts: All dryness has left Iowa,
Noah Rohlfing," Michigan’s wheat harvest is moving along at a rapid speed — and a recent change in the weather is part of the reason why. 

 Following a wet June and early July for much of Michigan’s lower peninsula — particularly in the western half of the state, according to data from the Iowa Environmental Mesonet — the last two weeks have seen drier conditions throughout the state. This has allowed harvest to take off: As of the most recent U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) Crop Progress report on July 29, Michigan is 90% finished with the winter wheat harvest. 

 This is 32 percentage points ahead of wheat harvest progress at the same point in 2023, and 20 percentage points ahead of the state’s five-year average. 

 Also running ahead of schedule is Michigan’s oat harvest. As of July 29, 31% of the oat crop in the state has been harvested. The five-year average for Michigan is only 2%, and in 2023 at this stage of the year only 5% of the crop was harvested. 

 Range and pasture conditions in the state were also positive, with 77% labeled as Good/Excellent. Less rain meant hay second cuttings were at 46% complete, per the Michigan-specific Crop Progress report from the National Agricultural Statistics Service (NASS). 

 In southwestern Michigan, field crops have made progress after a reprieve from rain allowed standing water to drain from soybean fields, according to the 
. However, Extension reporters Nicolle Ritchie and Angie Gradiz did provide some detail about the impact the standing water has had on the area’s soybean crops.

 “Many soybeans are stunted and yellow from standing in pooled water caused by the heavy rains earlier this month,” Ritchie and Gradiz wrote. “This free water provides favorable conditions for Phytophthora stem and root rot infection.”

 Currently, 59% of Michigan’s soybean crop is in Good/Excellent condition. Soybeans are setting pods at 34% as of July 29, four percentage points below the state’s five-year average. Blooming is at 77%. 

 July was still wetter than average overall in the state, with chunks of southwestern, central, and eastern Michigan seeing upwards of 5 inches of precipitation more than the July average. Most of the Upper Peninsula was below its average for July, according to the Iowa Environmental Mesonet. 

 Rainfall throughout the growing season has left Michigan with only 3% of the state experiencing abnormally dry conditions, according to the latest data from the U.S. Drought Monitor. 

 The short-term predictions from the National Weather Service‘s Climate Prediction Center put most of Michigan with a higher-than-average chance of lower temperatures from Aug. 8 to Aug. 14, in tandem with a majority of the northern Corn Belt states. In addition, expectations are that Michigan will receive above-average precipitation over the same time period. 

 This runs counter to what the CPC predicts for the state overall for August — mainly above-average temperatures and equal chances of higher or lower precipitation. 

 Above-average temperatures are also expected in Michigan for September and October as growing season transitions into harvest time, the CPC said. Michigan is far from alone in this expectation: Only northern Minnesota and eastern North Dakota are not projected to experience above-average temps over the same time period. 

 Precipitation predictions have so far declined to move Michigan one way or the other.

 Extreme heat reaching well into the triple digits is again on tap today from central Kansas east into southern Indiana, according to National Weather Service maps. 

 Heat indexes in central Arkansas are expected to hit 114° Fahrenheit this afternoon, the agency said. 

 About 68% of U.S. corn was in good or excellent condition as of Sunday, unchanged week to week, the Department of Agriculture said in a report. That’s still well ahead of the 57% that earned top ratings at this point a year earlier. 

 Eight percent of the crop was in the dough stage, while 41% was silking, USDA said. 

 Sixty-eight percent of the soybean crop was in good or excellent condition at the start of the week, also unchanged for a second straight week. About 55% earned such ratings during the same week last year. 

 Eighteen percent of the crop was setting pods, and 51% was blooming, the government said. 

 Analysts polled by Reuters were expecting USDA to boost its ratings for both corn and beans to 69% good or excellent. 

 Spring wheat conditions improved, rising to 77% good or excellent from 75% the previous week. That’s also up from 51% that earned top ratings a year earlier. 

 Some 76% of spring wheat was headed. 

 The winter wheat harvest continues with 71% now in the bin, up from 63% a week earlier and ahead of the prior five-year average of 62%, USDA said.

 Inspections of soybeans for overseas delivery declined week to week while grain assessments improved, according to the Ag Department.

 Soybean inspections for export fell to 168,593 metric tons in the seven days that ended on July 11, USDA said. That’s down from 294,209 a week earlier but topped the 160,844 tons assessed at the same point last year. 

 Examinations of corn were reported at 1.08 million tons, up from 1.02 million a week earlier, and well ahead of the 419,214 tons inspected during the same week in 2023. 

 Wheat inspections last week totaled 533,828 tons, up from 343,359 tons a week earlier and 273,443 tons at this point last year, the government said. 

 Since the start of the marketing year on Sept. 1, USDA has inspected 44.6 million metric tons of corn for export, up from 40 million tons during the same timeframe a year earlier. 

 Soybean assessments since the beginning of September now stand at 42 million tons, down from 49.9 million in the same period last year. 

 Wheat inspections since the start of the grain's marketing year on June 1 were reported at 2.27 million tons, up from 1.79 million tons at this point last year, USDA said in its report.

 Weather woes in some growing areas globally are underpinning futures. 

 Ukraine said its corn and sunflower harvests may fall by 35% due to hot weather and drought.

 “Productive moisture reserves are extremely low,” the Ukrainian Agri Council said in a statement. “Despite the fact that the temperature is expected to drop, the lack of precipitation will negatively affect the development of these crops.”  

 The country’s corn crop is starting to bloom and a lack of precipitation could lead to a “critical” situation, the council said. 

 About 15% to 30% of corn from Romania was “burned” by heat this year, leading to a reduction in global supplies, the report said. 

 In Canada, limited rains and elevated temperatures in parts of Alberta and Saskatchewan will increase stress on spring wheat, said Don Keeney, an agricultural meteorologist with Maxar.

 Exporters of agricultural products from the U.S. may have a new customer in mind, one that most wouldn’t think as a destination: Venezuela. 

 The country was the sixth-biggest importer of U.S. agricultural products in South America last year, importing $670 million worth of goods, USDA said in an attaché report from its Caracas office. While that's down 10% year over year, growth opportunities abound. 

 “Venezuela continues to grow its retail sector, supermarkets are well stocked, and U.S. brand awareness and acceptance have increased over the last two years,” the report said. 

 Agricultural imports by the South American country have the potential to improve moving forward, and the U.S. is well positioned due to product pricing, quality, and geographical proximity, USDA said. 

 U.S. companies stand to benefit from the popularity of products from the States and a “de facto dollarization of the Venezuelan economy,” the agency said. More than 60% of the country’s food is derived from imports and shipments from the U.S. can arrive in three to five days, a much shorter timeframe than other suppliers. 

 Still, there are challenges: Venezuela has trade agreements with countries in South and Central America, inflation and devaluation have hurt consumer purchases, and the country’s processes for permitting and registering certain ag or food items can be cumbersome, USDA said. 

 Flood warnings and watches have been issued for parts of southern Missouri, southern Illinois and northern Arkansas, according to the National Weather Service. 

 Storms are forecast in the region this morning with some producing large hail and winds up to 60 mph, the agency said. 

 As much as 5 inches of precipitation fell in the overnight hours and another 1 to 3 inches of rain are expected per hour this morning. Flooding is ongoing in some areas. 

 In the southern Plains, strong storms are likely this afternoon, mostly in the western Texas and Oklahoma panhandles, NWS said. 

 Thunderstorms are possible every day through Monday. Stronger storms may develop in the region on Friday and Saturday, the agency said.

Chuck Abbott," The farm bill coalition — the rural and urban alliance credited with carrying farm bills to enactment — “is a one-sided talking point,” said House Agriculture chairman 
 on Tuesday in insisting on a $53 billion increase in farm subsidies and cuts in SNAP. Time is running out for passage of the new farm bill this year, and farm groups, silent for weeks, are now calling for prompt congressional action.

 Election-year politics soon will freeze legislative progress in the already polarized House and Senate. The House was not expected to vote until after Labor Day on the farm bill that was approved by its Agriculture Committee before Memorial Day. The only hope may be passage of a House-Senate compromise bill after the Nov. 5 general elections.

 “I will not apologize for advancing a bill that seeks to put the farm back in the farm bill,” said Thompson, who combines affability with red-meat rhetoric, at a committee hearing on agricultural finances. “The romanticized ‘farm bill coalition’ often talked about is a one-sided talking point.”

 After describing Senate Agriculture chairwoman Debbie Stabenow as “a meddling Senate Democrat,” Thompson said he was open to “an informal pre-conference negotiation with the Senate” on make-up of the farm bill. Stabenow aides said Thompson proposed huge increases in farm spending without paying for it and bill unduly favors Southern growers over farmers in the Midwest and Plains.

 Stabenow has said she will not accept cuts in SNAP or removal of “guardrails” on climate funding; both are goals of House and Senate Republicans. She has proposed increases of at least 5% in so-called reference prices for major crops. The House bill and a Senate Republican “framework” call for an average 15% increase.

 “A farm bill is not passed through slogans and posturing,” said Stabenow’s office. “The path to passing a bipartisan farm bill has always been holding together the broad farm and food coalition that has formed the foundation of every successful bill for decades.”

 At the House hearing, Thompson said his committee-approved farm bill “represents the largest permanent investment in the farm safety net, conservation, trade promotion, specialty crops, research, and livestock biosecurity in more than two decades.”

 Republicans would foolishly restrict USDA access to emergency funds at the same time their nominee for the White House, former president Donald Trump, might start a new trade war, said Georgia Rep. 
, the senior Democrat on the House Agriculture Committee. The Trump administration tapped the USDA fund for $23 billion in aid to farmers during the Sino-U.S. trade war.

 “Bottom line, if we want to get a farm bill done this year, as these witnesses want, we have to find a different way to pay for it without locking away this important tool for five years,” said Scott.

 “My door remains open to negotiation from any partner willing to come to the table with a serious proposal, not more red lines,” said Thompson. Scott said he was willing to work on bipartisan improvements to the farm bill, “But you must be open to change.”

 Farm Belt witnesses described extreme financial stress from high production costs and multi-year decline in commodity prices. Minnesota crop and dairy farmer Dana Allen-Tully said a farm bailout package may be needed because farmers cannot make a profit at current market prices for corn and soybeans. North Carolina cotton farmer David Dunlow said “another straight extension of the current farm bill is unacceptable….many farmers like me and others across the country will not be farming next year without some sort of assistance.”

 “Bankers believe they may be ‘looking over a cliff’ in regard to the agricultural economy without changes to current government policy,” said Tony Hotchkiss, of the American Bankers Association. “This includes adjustments to reference prices and ensuring that crop insurance covers loss appropriately for producers.”

 USDA forecasts of 
, an indicator of profitability, are more sanguine. Net income was a record $185.5 billion in 2022 and is forecast at $116.1 billion this year, a steep decline but still the fourth-highest net income on record and 15% above its 10-year average. The debt-to-asset ratio would rise slightly this year to 12.8%, a moderate level. The USDA was scheduled to update its forecast on Sept. 5.

 Summit Carbon Solutions argues that the main components of two county ordinances in Iowa that sought to limit the placement of carbon dioxide pipelines are entirely overridden by the authority of state and federal regulators.

 The company reasserted those arguments in a recent brief in federal court — its response to 
 by Shelby and Story counties of 
 late last year that agreed with Summit. An injunction prevents the counties from enforcing the ordinances.

 The filings of written arguments by both sides of the case set the stage for oral arguments before a panel of Eighth Circuit U.S. Court of Appeals judges. The oral arguments are not yet scheduled. The judges are expected to issue a decision sometime next year.

 Summit seeks to build a 2,500-mile pipeline system in five states to transport captured carbon dioxide from ethanol producers to North Dakota, where the greenhouse gas would be pumped into the ground. It received preliminary approval in Iowa 
.

 The work is incentivized by generous federal tax credits with the goal of slowing climate change. But many opponents of the project worry about the safety of people and animals near the pipeline that might be suffocated if it ruptures.

 The county ordinances create minimum separation distances — or setbacks — between the pipelines and populated places, such as cities, homes and livestock buildings.

 The federal judge who ruled against the first county ordinances said, in part, they were so restrictive that they might make it impossible for a carbon dioxide pipeline to be built at all.

 A handful of ordinances that were adopted by other counties — most of which are also the target of pending lawsuits by Summit — were increasingly less restrictive. The most recent one was approved in April 
, which has not been sued. Summit has declined to comment on the matter.

 Chief Judge Stephanie Rose, of the federal Southern District of Iowa, said the Shelby and Story ordinances’ placement requirements are overruled by state regulators — the Iowa Utilities Commission — and that their safety-related provisions are the jurisdiction of federal regulators — the Pipeline and Hazardous Materials Safety Administration.

 Rose went further and decided that the counties’ placement requirements are also a safety feature and are overridden by PHMSA, but the agency itself has contradicted the judge.

 “Local governments have traditionally exercised broad powers to regulate land use, including setback distances and property development that includes development in the vicinity of pipelines,” wrote Alan Mayberry, a pipeline safety administrator for PHMSA, to Summit in September. “Nothing in the federal pipeline safety law impinges on these traditional prerogatives of local — or state — government, so long as officials do not attempt to regulate the field of pipeline safety preempted by federal law.”

 However, Summit argues Rose was correct about the relationship of setbacks and safety, and its attorneys point to an early version of Story’s ordinance: “Story County started down this path solely out of concern for pipeline safety,” attorney Ryan Koopmans wrote in the recent appeal brief. “The county’s first ordinance, No. 306, focused only on setbacks because there are ‘risks in the event of a spill or rupture.’”

 Summit further says county ordinance provisions that obviously pertain to safety — such as requirements to disclose certain information to local emergency officials to aid their potential response to a breach — is also PHMSA’s jurisdiction.

 As for determining the pipeline routes, Summit argues state law gives the Iowa Utilities Commission absolute authority: “It does not matter whether Summit or any other pipeline company could somehow thread the needle through the counties’ heavily restrictive setbacks, or whether the counties would grant variances and let the pipeline pass through anyway (and they clearly will not),” Koopmans wrote.

 The American Petroleum Institute, which lobbies for the nation’s oil and natural gas industries, and the Liquid Energy Pipeline Association also recently filed a brief in support of Summit’s positions.

 They said pipelines are vital to the U.S. economy, are the safest way to transport energy products, and that the ordinances would have “far-reaching ramifications and unintended consequences.”

 “PHMSA, and PHMSA alone, has the authority to regulate the safety of interstate pipelines,” wrote Christina Manfredi McKinley, an attorney who represents the groups. “The counties’ broad-based ordinances threaten to topple this balance, and with it, not just PHMSA’s nationwide system of pipeline safety standards, but also, millions of miles of pipeline systems that transport the nation’s energy commodities and support the nation’s economy. This observation is not hyperbolic. Far from it. … The court should not countenance the counties’ vaguely cloaked attempts to legislate beyond the scope of their authority, however disguised.”

 The ultimate effect of the court action on the pending lawsuits against other counties is not yet clear. They have been paused until the Shelby and Story appeals conclude.

 PHMSA is in the process of revamping its safety standards for carbon dioxide pipelines, and the counties have said the current rules are not adequate to protect the public. They argue that there is room for some measure of local control of the issue.

 About 82% of the domestic winter wheat crop was in the bin at the start of the week, the U.S. Department of Agriculture said in a report. That’s up from 76% a week earlier and the prior five-year average of 80%. 

 Seventy-four percent of U.S. spring wheat was in good or excellent condition as of Sunday, down from 77% a week earlier, the agency said. That’s still well above the 42% that earned top ratings at the same point last year. 

 One percent of the crop was harvested at the beginning of the week, USDA said. 

 Last week’s three-day tour of North Dakota’s spring wheat fields showed a favorable outlook for the crop. 

 The Wheat Quality Council’s annual tour of the state showed projected yields of 54.5 bushels an acre, up from last year’s forecast for 47.4 bushels, U.S. Wheat Associates said. Durum yields are projected at 45.3 bushels an acre, up from 43.9 bushels a year earlier.

 North American sales dropped 16% to $837.8 million and South American sales plunged 42% to $348.9 million. Sales in Europe and the Middle East (EME) lost 4.4% to $1.9 billion, and Asia Pacific sales declined 34% to $157 million. 

 In the first six months of 2024, total sales lost 14% to $6.18 billion, AGCO said. North American sales dropped 18% to $1.57 billion, South American sales were down 41% to $652.3 million, EME sales fell 1.7% to $3.63 billion and Asian sales dropped 26% to $323.7 million.

 “Softer industry sales, lower end-market demand and de-stocking efforts all contributed to lower sales [in the North American market],” the company said. “The most significant sales declines occurred in the hay equipment, mid-range, and high-horsepower tractor categories.”

Natalina Sents Bausch," As drought continues to intensify in North Carolina, the corn crop is shriveling up. More than 90% of the state’s crop is in fair condition, or worse, according to USDA’s Crop Progress report published July 15.


 Jeremy Petree has been in the crop insurance business for 15 years. “There will be a lot of claims paid this year,” he says. A farmer of 40-plus years and client recently remarked, “It’s never been this bad.”


 Petree added, “I know there was some hope that the genetics of the corn crop would help it recover and surprise everyone, but I think it’s getting late enough that the corn crop is just not going to be there.”


 According to the most recent Crop Progress report, 44% of North Carolina corn is in very poor condition, 29% is poor, 18% is fair, 9% is good. There is no excellent corn in the state.


 Some farmers are attempting to salvage their corn crop by chopping it for silage, but that won’t be an option for everyone, says Petree. “There’s so much of it out there.”


 On Monday USDA said 85% of North Carolina’s corn is silking, 3 percentage points ahead of both the five-year average and last year at this time.


 The report noted 43% of the corn crop has reached the dough growth stage, significantly ahead of the 34% five-year average. Last year at this time 32% of North Carolina’s corn had achieved dough.


 Kevin Matthews is a fourth-generation farmer in East Bend, North Carolina. “Our early corn is very rough, and the mid plantings are fair with the later just begging for rain before it tassels.”


 He’s grateful for his irrigation, adding, “If a drip tape or sprinkler isn’t doing its job, the crop will show you quickly.”


 Other North Carolina crops are struggling in the dry conditions, too. USDA rated 7% of soybeans very poor, 24% poor, 43% fair, and 26% good. There are no excellent soybeans in North Carolina.


 Matthews says his soybean crop is holding on, but “the deer damage is horrendous. Wildlife are eating the crops faster than they can grow with such little moisture.”


 Cotton is struggling, too. USDA rated 7% of North Carolina’s cotton crop very poor, 14% poor, 39% fair, 44% good, and 5% excellent.


 North Carolina peanuts were rated 3% very poor, 9% poor, 38% fair, 46% good, and 4% excellent for the week ending July 14.


 Pasture and range conditions in the state were rated 12% very poor, 43% poor, 32% fair, and 13% good. There was no excellent pasture reported in North Carolina.


 Farmers are harvesting their second cutting of hay, but not as quickly as last year. USDA said 27% of second cutting was complete the week ending July 14. That’s well behind the five-year average of 38%.


 Drought has spread and intensified quickly over the last three months. At the beginning of April more than 88% of the state was free of drought stress.


 The most recent drought maps, published July 11, 2024, show 100% of the state is suffering from moisture stress. D3 extreme drought covers a portion of Columbus County in the southern tip of the state. More than 19% of North Carolina reported D2 severe drought conditions. Almost 68% of the state is in D1 moderate drought. Nearly 12% of North Carolina is abnormally dry.


 The Crop Progress report rated North Carolina topsoil moisture 15% very short, 34% short, 47% adequate, and 4% surplus. Subsoil moisture was rated 11% very short, 37% short, 51% adequate, and 1% surplus.


 Petree urges farmers with drought stricken crops to call their crop insurance agent promptly to get on their list. With such widespread losses in the state, “there’s a lot of corn that needs to be appraised,” he says.


 It is important to call your crop insurance agent before you start chopping or destroying anything. It needs to be appraised first. “If a crop is destroyed before someone’s had a chance to take a look at it, then there’s really not a lot anyone can do,” explains Petree.


 He adds, “Don’t be afraid to call your agent.” Crop insurance coverage is based on what production is actually harvested. “It’s not like car insurance where just turning something in and not getting any money out of it is going to increase your premium,” he says.

 A heat wave that baked parts of the U.S. Corn Belt has moved on and cooler weather that will cause less stress to plants is expected in the next few days. 

 Precipitation is expected in much of the central and western Corn Belt in the next three days, according to maps from the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration. As much as 1.5 inches is expected in parts of east-central Nebraska and counties in western Iowa. 

 Global soybean inventories in the 2024/2025 marketing year that starts on Sept. 1 are forecast by the U.S. Department of Agriculture to rise to 127.8 million metric tons. 

 That would be up from an estimate for 111.3 million tons at the end of the current marketing year, USDA said in its monthly World Agricultural Supply and Demand Estimates (WASDE) report last week. 

 Still, underpinning soybean and grain prices is extremely hot weather in the Black Sea region and growing areas of Canada. 

 Temperatures will reach triple digits this week in Black Sea growing areas and in southeastern Europe, Commodity Weather Group said in a note to clients. 

 Heat in parts of Saskatchewan and Alberta is expected to stress wheat and canola growing in the Canadian provinces, CWG said. 

 Soybean futures for November delivery fell 6¼¢ to $10.34¾ a bushel overnight on the Chicago Board of Trade. Soymeal dropped $2.50 to $309.60 a short ton and soy oil was up 0.24¢ to 44.23¢ a pound. 

 Corn futures for December delivery lost 2¢ to $4.08¾ a bushel.

 Wheat futures for September delivery rose ½¢ to $5.39¾ a bushel, while Kansas City futures fell ¼¢ to $5.60 3/4 a bushel. 

 Ethanol output rose to the highest level in more than six months while inventories plunged, according to the Energy Information Administration.

 Production rose to 1.106 million barrels a day, on average, on the week that ended on July 12, the agency said in a report. 

 That’s up from 1.054 million barrels per day the previous week and the highest level since Dec. 22, EIA said. 

 In the Midwest, by far the biggest producing region, output came in at an average of 1.046 million barrels a day, up from 1.001 million the previous week. 

 Gulf Coast production was reported at 28,000 barrels per day, up from 21,000 barrels the week prior, the government said. 

 East Coast output was again steady at 12,000 barrels a day, on average, and Rocky Mountain and West Coast production were both unchanged at 10,000 barrels. 

 Ethanol inventories in the seven days that ended on July 12 totaled 23.16 million barrels, EIA said. That’s down from 23.603 million barrels seven days earlier and the lowest level in six weeks.

 Flood warnings remain in effect in several counties along the Illinois-Missouri border along waterways in central Illinois, according to the National Weather Service. 

 The Mississippi River near Grafton, Illinois, just north of St. Louis, was at about 23 feet late last night and is expected to reach 23.1 feet this afternoon, the agency said. Flood stage in the area is at 20 feet. 

 Near Hannibal, Missouri, the river late Wednesday was at 21.5 feet, topping flood stage of 17 feet, NWS said.

 Thunderstorms are possible in parts of central Nebraska and north-central Kansas, the agency said. Severe weather is unlikely. 

 More storms are expected Friday evening into Saturday in the area, with some potentially severe late Friday night. Damaging winds and heavy rainfall are the biggest threats associated with the storms, NWS said.

Noah Rohlfing," At the end of May, Tennessee crops and soil were faring well, after a wet spring season. However, June and July have been different. Rapid-onset drought has hit much of central and eastern Tennessee, as high temperatures collided with a stop to regular rainfall. 

 According to data from the Iowa Environmental Mesonet, June 1–July 23, areas of central Tennessee experienced upwards of 5 inches less precipitation than the yearly average. 

 In the latest Drought Monitor report released July 25, 48.3% of the state is in D1 moderate drought or worse — a jump of 47 percentage points from April. Corn crop condition has also worsened; the most recent USDA Crop Progress report indicates that as of July 21, 51% of the state’s corn are in Good/Excellent condition — down from 56% the week prior.

 Soybeans are in 58% Good/Excellent condition — down from 62% the week prior.

 Tennessee Assistant State Climatologist William Tollefson said the sudden uptick in drought has been difficult on corn and pastures. 

 “The grasses were all brown, trees were showing signs of stress,” Tollefson says. “We got reports of cattle issues, like pastures, having to feed hay and bring in water. Some farmers were selling calves to reduce stress on their pastures.” 

 Corn was the other concern. “In certain counties, the drought hit right as tasseling was starting,” Tollefson says. “They were starting to silk. We had a report from one extension agent that the silks were turning black immediately because it was so hot and dry.”

 Hay has been impacted heavily. State Climatologist Andrew Joyner says there have been reports of calves being sold off in numbers above the yearly average due to a lack of viable hay. In Smith County, east of Nashville, he says, a reported 1,214 head were sold as of July 13 — a near-doubling of the 802 head sold in July 2023. 

 Pasture conditions in the latest Crop Progress report were only 24% Good/Excellent, with 42% of pastures rated as Poor/Very Poor. 

 Difficulties in the livestock and crops have left much of Tennessee wishing for consistent rains. 

 The National Weather Service Climate Prediction Center’s short-term forecast for the end of July and beginning of August expects above-average precipitation for Tennessee. The August monthly prediction indicates the same. Temperatures are forecast to continue to be high.

 “It seems like our pattern is shifting,” Joyner says.

 Tollefson and Joyner say Tennessee would need immense precipitation to emerge from drought conditions. Steady rainfall for for multiple days per week over a long period would be preferable to intense rainfall. That would help pastures and fields recover to pre-drought conditions.

 In the long term, Joyner says farmers are hoping for tropical moisture to come through in August, September, and October — which didn’t happen in 2023. 

 “Usually, they’re pretty helpful for us,” Joyner says. “Last year we didn’t have any. We are really hoping for some tropical moisture later into the fall to help during the end of the growing season and toward harvest season.”

FERN's Ag Insider," Lucrative tax credits of up to $1.25 a gallon should be available only for low-carbon fuels made from U.S.-grown feedstocks, 
 told the Biden administration on Wednesday. In a letter, the groups also said the government should broaden its list of climate-smart farming practices that produce lower-carbon “sustainable” crops.

 The letter was aimed at 45Z tax credits, which are to become available in 2025, for sustainable aviation fuel (SAF). The administration has yet to issue regulations for the credits. In April, it published a 
 for SAF produced from 2022-24. Under the guidance, only a fraction of U.S. biofuels would qualify for the 40B credits. The Biden administration has a goal of increasing SAF production to 3 billion gallons by 2030.

 “However, without clear domestic feedstock requirements, the benefits of this policy are at risk of being diverted from American farmers,” said the letter. “The 45Z tax credit has the potential to be a game-changer for our industry.”

 The 40B guidelines lack a domestic feedstock requirement, said the letter, and they are too rigid in saying that jet fuel produced from ethanol must come from corn grown on farms that used no-till, planted cover crops following harvest, and applied enhanced-efficiency fertilizer or be made from biomass-based diesel derived from soybeans grown on farms that used no-till and cover crops. “Additional options from compliance must be considered,” the groups said.

 The letter was signed by the American Farm Bureau Federation, the National Farmers Union, the National Corn Growers Association, and the American Soybean Association.

 Separately, fertilizer maker CF Industries and ethanol maker POET announced a 
 in the western Corn Belt that would use low-carbon ammonia fertilizer to grow corn for ethanol production. The practice “can reduce the carbon intensity of ethanol up to 10 percent,” said the companies. The test would begin this fall and continue through the 2025 harvest.

Chuck Abbott," The EPA will have to take a new look at requests for three dozen “hardship” exemptions from the ethanol mandate under a ruling by the U.S appeals court in Washington. Ethanol makers, “extremely disappointed” by the ruling, said they were considering a response, “which may include seeking further review of today’s decision.”

 At issue was EPA’s denial in April 2022 of 36 requests by small refiners for a waiver from the Renewable Fuel Standard requirement to blend biofuels into gasoline for cars and pickup trucks. At the time, the EPA said the refineries did not face disproportionate economic harm if they had to buy credits, known as RINs, to make up for their failure to mix enough ethanol into gasoline.

 The appellate court vacated the denials on Friday and ordered the cases remanded to the EPA for further proceedings. The court opinion was sealed from public view so the its reasoning and specific instruction to EPA were not known. In April, judges on the appeals court questioned whether the EPA was overly strict in determining if a refiner faced financial hardship in complying with the RFS, reported 
.

 “EPA’s decision in 2022 to deny the petitions was well-reasoned, based on sound economic analysis, and consistent with the Clean Air Act and the objectives of the Renewable Fuel Standard,” said 
—the American Coalition for Ethanol, Growth Energy, and the Renewable Fuels Association. “We will evaluate our next steps, which may include seeking further review of today’s decision. Our coalition remains resolute and committed to protecting and defending the proper implementation of the RFS.”

 During the Trump era, the EPA issued dozens of waivers from the RFS. Biofuel advocates said the exemptions amounted to a 1.4-billion-gallon reduction in ethanol demand at a time when the RFS generally set a target of blending 15 billion gallons a year of corn ethanol into motor fuel. When it took office, the Biden administration indicated it would be more stringent in evaluating requests for exemptions.

 Involved in the EPA’s decision in 2022 were exemptions granted by Trump officials for RFS obligations in 2018. The 36 exemptions were part of a Supreme Court ruling in 2021 on EPA discretion to issue RFS waivers. Based on that ruling, an appeals court told the EPA to decide by April 7, 2022, on whether or grant or deny them. The 
 and said it would create an alternative method of compliance for 31 refiners that did not require them to buy or retire RINs.

 In addition to remanding the exemptions to the EPA, the appellate court also dismissed a lawsuit challenging the EPA alternate method of compliance.

 that “House Republicans have pulled two government funding bills scheduled for a floor vote this week, signaling further peril for leadership’s doomed efforts to pass all 2025 spending measures before the August recess.”

 “Republicans’ funding bill for the Agriculture Department and the FDA, in addition to the Financial Services spending bill, will not be considered on the floor as originally planned, according to three sources familiar with the whipping problems,” Emma and Scholtes reported. “Both measures failed to clear the floor last summer, thanks to politically unpalatable funding levels and conservative policy riders, including language blocking abortion and contraceptive protections. Those same issues are ensnaring GOP leaders yet again, despite an effort to dial back on some of the more controversial provisions that previously stymied floor passage.”

 Politico’s Meredith Lee Hill wrote on the social media platform X that the main reason the bill was pulled from a House floor vote was that “conservatives wanted an amendment vote to re-add the controversial abortion pill rider centrist Rs had stripped out.”

 
 that “in remarks to reporters this week, Rep. Tom Cole (R-Okla.), chair of the powerful House Appropriations Committee, said he’d heard some ‘pro-life’ concerns over changes to the agriculture funding bill, which Republicans were previously expected to vote on this week.”

 “Earlier this year, Republicans notably left out language in the funding bill that would have limited access to the abortion pill mifepristone, after a similar push helped doom their fiscal 2024 plan following pushback from moderates,” Folley and Brooks reported.

 “’I think that the major objections that often go for the reason it didn’t pass last year have been removed, so I don’t see a problem with it,’” (Rep. Andy Harris (R-Md.), chair of the subcommittee that crafted the Ag-FDA Bill), who is a member of the House Freedom Caucus, also said when pressed about the bill not including the mifepristone language,” Folley and Brooks reported.

 “But that hasn’t stopped others from taking issue with the move,” 
. “‘That’s one of the issues that I identified,’ Rep. Chip Roy (R-Texas), another member of the House Freedom Caucus, said when pressed on the matter, as well as his support for other measures. ‘My belief is, you got to figure that stuff out, and you got to know in the aggregate what you’re trying to accomplish,’ he said. ‘So, I think that bill’s currently stuck, and then we’ll have to kind of see what the deal is.'”

 
 that “rumors are already flying that GOP leaders might abandon their appropriations push altogether, leaving at the end of this week for August recess rather than stick around to sustain more self-inflicted spending wounds.”

 GARDEN CITY, Kan. — Western Kansas is hopping this summer, as the number of grasshoppers spikes.

 Kansas State University Research and Extension Entomologist Anthony Zukoff said wet weather patterns this spring are supporting the presence of large grasshopper populations across western and central portions of the state.

 Zukoff said hot, dry summers increase the likelihood of young grasshoppers, or nymphs, surviving to adulthood. More adult grasshoppers mean increased egg production during cooler months. If the following spring is warm and wet, more eggs hatch, and more nymphs can survive.

 “So, several years of hot, dry summers followed by warm, wet springs can eventually lead to large populations of grasshoppers in some regions,” Zukoff said.

 Ag producers in western Kansas will have lessened chances for rainfall over the next several days. The extended outlook from meteorologists at the National Weather Service office in Dodge City calls for thunderstorm chances to taper off, and temperatures to remain around 90°F through the end of the month.

 K-State Assistant State Climatologist Matt Sittel said the hottest point of the summer has passed, with five days in July registering above 100°F across much of the state.

 Sittel said July 15 was the hottest day so far this year in Kansas, with an average high temperature across the Kansas Mesonet weather observation system of 102°F. At least 30 Mesonet sites reached 100°F each day July 12–15. The hottest temperature reading of the year for Kansas came on July 13, when Webster Dam in Rooks County recorded a high of 111°F.

 Sittel said the probabilities stretching into August favor above-normal temperatures and near-normal chances of precipitation for most of the state.

 Zukoff said the extra rainfall in early spring has helped spur leafy plant growth, including broadleaf weeds, which grasshoppers thrive in. Ag producers should be aware of higher-than-normal grasshopper numbers, but most crops should be mature enough to withstand some defoliation from grasshoppers eating them, according to Zukoff.

 He said five to eight grasshoppers per square yard in corn or sorghum fields may be enough to warrant insecticide treatment.

 “Later this season, fall-planted crops could be at risk, especially as alternate food sources are controlled or go dormant,” Zukoff said.

 If an ag producer planting alfalfa finds 15 or more grasshoppers per square yard around the planting area, Zukoff recommends treating the area before planting.

 For wheat, the vegetated borders around the planting areas should be scouted at least 10 days before planting, Zukoff said, with treatment recommended if there are seven to 12 grasshoppers per square yard.

 Zukoff said three or more grasshoppers per square yard within a wheat field can destroy seedling wheat stands. Seed treatments can protect emerging wheat plants for several weeks, as long as the grasshopper population remains low.

XtremeAg," XtremeAg farmers in Maryland and North Carolina manage impact of drought on early planted corn and soybeans.

 


 The drought continues. The forecast has been very encouraging, 40% to 70% chance of precipitation at least 9 or 10 days of the 12-day forecast. If you’re fortunate enough to receive a rain shower in this area, they are light. Seems like they fall in the same area, but we are fortunate that some farms received rain.

 Irrigation has been a blessing on those few acres that have not received any showers, however this is our first crop to be totally raised on irrigation and let me tell you, if a drip tape or sprinkler isn’t doing its job the crop will show you quickly. Our early corn is very rough, and the mid plantings are fair with the later just begging for rains before it tassels. Those acres are getting Veltyma, BoronMax with Fulltec, Finishline, Sweet Success, and of course, Terramar to help it begin a successful pollination.

 Soybeans continue to hold on. The deer damage is horrendous, they can eat them faster than they can grow with such little moisture. It’s interesting that this year the deer are going after the corn over the soybeans. If they have a choice, we think the soybeans are just tough with little moisture and they chew on the corn stalks while leaving the leaves of the plant laying on the ground! I’ve never seen this widespread issue before.


 


 We have now entered the fourth quarter of the 2024 crop. It has definitely been a challenging year. Wet early and dry late. We had high hopes to get some moisture from tropical storm Beryl, but we did not have success.


 Our corn is approaching black layer and the soybeans are at R6. The February-planted soybeans will get one more watering and then desiccation. Looking back, I wish I had planted 1,000 acres at that time, but you just never know.

 I do think that our soybean crop looks really good, but the corn may be a little off this year. It had such a rough start, and never really made that difference up. We are forecasted to have a really hot and dry September, which should aid in a good harvest. We are about 30 to 45 days out in corn harvest, so I will definitely know something soon.


 


 Early-planted corn on the east coast is extremely bad. The drought area affected goes from Pennsylvania to Georgia. It’s the worst I’ve ever seen in my career as a farmer. A lot of areas are a zero yield. We have a little bit of rain relieving heat and drought for a small amount of time and it could help late-May-planted corn, but we think the damage has been done at this point.

 The early-planted soybeans struggled with wet weather early, then severe drought. Soybeans are extremely short and struggled to canopy. Somehow, they are still holding on for the time being. There was a window in mid- to late May where the soybeans were planted that actually look fair. A fair amount of double crop soybeans was replanted because there was just enough moisture at planting to germinate them, then they died.


 All in all, the crops in the east are a complete disaster.

 Northern California’s Park Fire has surpassed 360,000 acres and triggered evacuation orders affecting four counties, 
. The network added that by Sunday morning, containment had increased to 12%, according to Cal Fire.

 The state issued evacuation orders for four northern counties — Butte, Plumas, Shasta, and Tehama — the network's Richard Ramos, Brandon Downs, and Cecilio Padilla reported Sunday. They said the state's largest wildfire this year and California's seventh-largest ever has scorched an area more than five times the size of the city of Sacramento.

 The wildfire has threatened cattle, bees, and other livestock as it advanced into Tehama County from its starting point in north Chico, 
. “It has been a rough six years for agribusiness owners in Butte and Tehama counties, who fought to save their farms from two other major wildfires and numerous smaller fires,” Skropanic reported.

 Smoke settling in the valley can make harvesting difficult and unpleasant for farmers, but ranchers and honeybee keepers are directly in the fire’s path, Rory Crowley, a commercial agribusiness loan officer in Paradise, told Skropanic. “They’re on summer range, which is up in the mountains,” he said. “Cattle and bees need water, so they summer at higher altitudes.”

 Area ranchers under evacuation orders were hesitant to leave their stock, Crowley told the newspaper.

 Eastern Oregon’s Durkee Fire is affecting farmers and ranchers in that region, 
. “Ranchers in Vale told KGW there’s no way to know at this time just how many cattle — and ranches — have been lost to the flames,” she said.

 Rancher Mark McBride told McCarty the blaze was “completely devastating,” noting one of his family's ranches was “right in the middle of it, and one of them is next to come if we can’t get it stopped.” McBride, also a volunteer firefighter for Vale Rangeland Fire Protection Association, added: “High emotions, high losses. And it will remain that way for a generation.”

 The fire forced a rancher in far eastern Oregon's Rye Valley to leave behind 150 pair of mothers and calves, a wildfire fighter told an Idaho TV reporter. Blake Maxwell, based in Montana, 
 that if the cattle survive, they are most likely sick or injured.

 “I watched fire corral these cows in the corner of a pasture,” Maxwell told Shumpert, of KTVB. “I tried to get up there and cut the fence for them, and I couldn’t quite get there in time.” Shumpert said it was unsure if the cattle survived because the area has not been surveyed.

 “A lot of those ranchers they may have to sell off most of their cows, take them to the sale barn, because they can’t afford to feed them, because the grass they’re depending on is now ash on the ground,” Maxwell told the reporter.

 As avian influenza is being detected in more and more dairy herds across the U.S., Iowa State University researchers have found a possible “why” connection to the virus being found in raw milk.

 A study published this month by a team in ISU’s College of Veterinary Medicine found that bovine mammary gland tissue held receptors for the avian influenza virus, offering a potential explanation for how cattle are being infected.

 Todd Bell, a professor of veterinary pathology and co-author of the study, said the idea to look at mammary glands as a potential entry point for the virus came after it was identified in raw milk. Two ISU alums in the spring identified an illness impacting cattle in Texas as

 To understand the concept, Bell suggested thinking of viruses as like keys, and receptors are like locks to cells. In order for the avian flu virus to enter a cell and reproduce, it needs the right receptor. The research team found that receptor on cattle mammary glands.

 Another receptor they found is connected to human influenza, Bell said, which is important because it opens up the possibility of a cell being infected by both viruses, potentially causing the creation of a new virus.

 “To our knowledge, that hasn’t happened yet in this particular outbreak, but we wanted to look for those receptors to understand what might be possible and hopefully stop the transmission and stop that from happening,” Bell said.

 The team also looked at the respiratory system to try and identify evidence of the bird flu, but found little there, narrowing down the possibilities of how cattle are being infected.

 According to the 
, as of July 12 the avian influenza had been detected in dairy herds in 12 states, including 13 herds in Iowa. While the virus is being detected in raw milk, the pasteurization process ensures it is safe to be consumed.

 While Bell and his colleague’s work is still very much focused on the “why” of avian flu in dairy herds and its spread, he said the hope is that their research will help inform regulators in making decisions on testing and biosecurity measures to try and stop the spread of the virus. He said there is some literature that states the virus can live on milking machines for a few hours after an infected cow is hooked up to them, offering one potential method of spread.

 “We hope that what we find will help them make those types of decisions, specifically if we can find it in mammary tissue, then how do we stop it from getting to that mammary tissue in the first place,” Bell said.

 Next steps for Bell and his colleagues include looking at the milk and mammary glands of other domestic animals, like sheep and goats, to see if they also carry receptors for the avian flu. Bell said they will also look at their respiratory systems and gastrointestinal tracts to see if the flu could have other points of entry, like if a wild bird with the virus defecates into a water supply and farm animals drink the infected water.

 Iowa Secretary of Agriculture Mike Naig said during “
” last week that longitudinal studies are also being conducted on farms to test every single animal housed there in order to track how the virus moves and determine how it exits the herd.

 “Because it will, it will eventually exit that herd and you want to be able to track those things and have an expectation of how long does that last,” he said during the program.

 Corn and soybeans were little changed. 

 Seventy-six percent of the U.S. winter wheat crop was harvested at the start of this week, up from 71% seven days earlier and above the five-year average 72%, according to the USDA. 

 Earlier this month the agency raised its forecast for global stockpiles at the end of the 2024/2025 marketing year (ending May 31) to 257.2 million metric tons from 252.3 million tons.

 The agency also raised its outlook for U.S. inventories to 23.3 million metric tons from 20.6 million a month earlier. 

 Russian grain output, which had been threatened by dry weather and frost throughout the growing season, may be better than previously expected. Production is now forecast at 130.5 million metric tons, up from 127.4 million tons, consultant SovEcon said. The consultant raised its forecast for wheat production to 84.2 million tons.

 Soybean futures for November delivery fell 2¢ to $10.61 a bushel. Soy meal lost 50¢ to $320.10 a short ton. Soy oil was down 0.16¢ to 43.94¢ a pound. 

 Ethanol output declined in the seven days ending on July 19, according to the Energy Information Administration (EIA). Production of the biofuel fell to an average 1.095 million barrels a day, the agency said. That’s down from an average 1.106 million barrels the previous week. 

 In the Midwest, by far the biggest producing region, output dropped to 1.035 million barrels, on average, from 1.046 million the week prior. Gulf Coast production fell to 26,000 barrels a day from 28,000, and West Coast output declined to 9,000 barrels from 10,000 the previous week, EIA said. 

 East Coast output was steady at 12,000 barrels a day, on average, and Rocky Mountain production rose to 12,000 barrels from 10,000 barrels a week earlier. 

 Ethanol stockpiles through July 19, meanwhile, jumped to 23.723 million barrels, EIA said. That’s the highest level since May 17, and up from 23.16 million a week earlier.

FERN's Ag Insider," California and Wisconsin still dominate U.S. milk production, accounting for one-third of total output, but the dairy industry went through a substantial restructuring in the past 20 years, said USDA analysts. There were 26,290 dairy herds licensed to sell milk in 2023, compared to 70,375 herds in 2003; and milk production of 226.4 billion pounds last year was 33% larger than the 170.3 billion pounds two decades earlier.

 Texas and Idaho expanded production to become two of the five largest dairy states during that period, each with 7% of U.S. production. Meanwhile, California’s share of production dipped to 18%, a decline of 3 percentage points. Wisconsin produces 14% of U.S. milk today, up 1 point from 2002.

 There are fewer dairy cows nationwide but they each produce more milk, and very large dairy farms, with more than 2,000 head, are the source of 39% of the milk supply. Dairy farms tend to be larger in the West.

 “Not only have dairy farms become larger, but they have become more specialized in dairy production, lowering their production of other farm commodities and depending more heavily on purchased rather than homegrown feeds,” said the Economic Research Service report. “Larger dairy farms have tended to be more specialized in dairy production than smaller dairy farms and are the greater adopters of the most advanced technologies, management practices, and production systems.”

 Tens of thousands of farmers or would-be farmers who say they suffered discrimination when they applied for assistance from the U.S. Department of Agriculture will get one-time payments that total about $2 billion from the federal government.

 “While this financial assistance is not compensation for anyone’s losses or pain endured, it is an acknowledgement,” U.S. Agriculture Secretary Tom Vilsack said Wednesday in a call with reporters.

 The payments are the result of a program — the Discrimination Financial Assistance Program — created by the Inflation Reduction Act of 2022 that was meant to aid farmers, ranchers and forest landowners. President Joe Biden said it was the result of his promise “to address this inequity when I became president.”

 The USDA received more than 58,000 applications from people who claimed discrimination based on race, color, national origin, sex, sexual orientation, gender identity, religion, age, marital status, disability and retaliation for “civil rights activity.”

 Vilsack could not immediately say what type of discrimination was most often indicated by the applicants, but the bulk of the payments went to farmers in southern states with higher percentages of Black residents.

 Payments 
 to people in every state and three of its territories, but residents of Alabama and Mississippi alone received almost half of the money. There were 30 people in Iowa who are set to receive a total of about $4 million.

 More than 43,000 people will be paid, Vilsack said. The payments range from $3,500 to $500,000, depending on the circumstances and effects of the discrimination.

 The department could not immediately supply a summary of those claims, but Vilsack said the discrimination resulted in loan denials, loan delays, higher interest rates and an overall lack of assistance.

 “We’ve made significant strides in breaking down barriers to access, and my hope is that people will begin to think differently about USDA, so that we can better serve all who want to participate in agriculture in the future,” Vilsack said.

 Specifically, Vilsack said the department’s Farm Service Agency, which administers farm loans, now has a more diverse leadership and loan assessment processes that rely less on human discretion.

 More than two-thirds of U.S. soybeans were in good or excellent condition as of Sunday, and while that’s down 1 percentage point from the previous week, it’s still well above the 52% that earned top ratings a year earlier, Department of Agriculture data shows. 

 Forty-four percent of the crop was setting pods and 77% was blooming, USDA said. 

 Some 68% of U.S. corn was in good or excellent shape at the start of the week, up a point from the previous reading, the agency said. A year ago, 55% of the crop saw top ratings. 

 Thirty percent was in the dough stage and 77% was silking. 

 Spring wheat conditions remain favorable with 74% rated good or excellent, down from 77% a week earlier but still up from 42% at the same point last year.

Chuck Abbott," Nine farmworkers at two egg farms in Colorado have contracted mild cases of bird flu since mid-July while killing and disposing of millions of infected chickens, said public health officials on Thursday. “These preliminary results again underscore the risk of exposure to infected animals,” said the 
 (CDC), which added that the risk to the general population remains low.

 The 
 said that approximately 118 people have been tested for the avian flu virus and 10 cases have been confirmed — nine on poultry farms since July 12 and one on a dairy farm in May. The national total, which includes three workers on dairy farms in Michigan and Texas, is 13 since April. In addition, a Colorado correctional inmate was infected with the H5N1 virus while culling an infected chicken flock in 2022.

 All of the infected poultry workers were employed on egg farms in Weld County, northeast of Boulder — six on one farm and three on the other. The CDC and the Colorado Department of Public Health jointly announced confirmation of the outbreak among workers on the second farm.

 “The three confirmed cases occurred in people who were working directly with infected poultry at a commercial egg layer operation that had reported an outbreak of H5 bird flu among poultry,” said the CDC. “All three people have mild illness and have been offered the antiviral drug oseltamivir for treatment. State and local officials continue to monitor poultry workers on farms with infected poultry.”

 According to the CDC, “The risk to the general public from H5N1 [avian flu virus] remains low.” Genetic tests show that the virus has not changed in ways that would make it more communicable, it said, and there have been no signs of unexpected increases in flu activity in Colorado or the rest of the country.

 Highly pathogenic avian influenza has killed nearly 101 million birds in domestic flocks in 48 states since the disease appeared in the United States in February 2022. Some 172 dairy herds in 13 states have been diagnosed with H5N1 infections since late March. Fifty of them are in Colorado.

 For weeks, the CDC has said people working with infected or potentially infected livestock should wear protective gear. For jobs like culling infected flocks, workers should wear water-resistant coveralls, masks, goggles, gloves, and boots, it says. Officials have acknowledged that it is difficult to assure compliance during prolonged physical labor in hot weather.

 “Historically, most human cases of bird flu infection have happened in people who are not wearing recommended personal protective equipment,” said the CDC. Investigators will ask about the use of protective equipment on the Colorado farms, it said.

 The Centers for Disease Control says the risk to the general public from the disease is low. It recommends using protective equipment, such as goggles, masks, and gloves, by people in contact with infected or possibly infected animals.

 The Colorado Department of Public Health and Environment said six workers, one more than reported earlier, contracted bird flu while killing and disposing of H5N1-infected hens on a poultry farm in Weld County, northeast of Boulder. “The workers … had mild symptoms, including conjunctivitis [pink eye] and common respiratory infection symptoms. None were hospitalized,” the agency said.

 In addition, a Colorado dairy farmworker contracted bird flu in early July; and in 2022 a correctional inmate participating in a pre-release program was infected with the virus. Since April, three other dairy farmworkers, in Michigan and Texas, have been diagnosed with bird flu.

Mariah Squire," According to USDA, Ohio corn progress is far ahead of historical averages, and two thirds of the crop is in good/excellent condition, but dry weather is worrying farmers.


 The percentage of corn at the silking stage in the Buckeye State jumped significantly since the last Crop Progress report and was also far ahead of historical averages. As of July 28, 81% of the state’s corn crop had reached the silking stage, an increase of 21 percentage points since the week prior. Last year at this time, only 54% of the state’s corn was at the silking stage. Further, the five-year average is just 60%.


 A quarter of Ohio’s corn had reached the dough stage as of July 28. With 25% of the corn crop at the dough stage, that’s a jump of 12 percentage points compared to the week prior. Last year at this time, just 2% of the state’s corn had reached the dough stage, and the five-year average for Ohio is only 9%. 


 As far as corn condition, two-thirds of Ohio’s corn crop was in good shape or better, and only 5% was rated very poor or poor the week ending July 28. The specific breakdown of corn conditions was 1% very poor, 4% poor, 29% fair, 55% good, and 11% excellent.

 Despite great numbers for corn progress and condition, weather conditions in Ohio are causing some concern. State Statistician Ben Torrance of the USDA NASS Ohio Field Office said that dry conditions were beginning to worry farmers. That’s according to the Ohio Crop Weather report released July 29. 


 The most recent U.S. Drought Monitor report showed that over 72% of the state was abnormally dry or worse as of July 30. Further, nearly 40% of the state was experiencing at least moderate drought conditions, and almost 14% of the state was experiencing severe drought conditions.


 Pickaway County is one of the areas experiencing the worst of the drought conditions. According to the U.S. Drought Monitor, over 99% of the county was in a severe drought as of the week ending July 30, and it’s been that way since the week ending July 16. What’s more, the whole county has seen at least moderate drought conditions since the week ending July 2.


 Brenna Gibson, who farms alongside her husband H.L. in Pickaway County, shared that they don’t expect the bumper crop they had last year by any means. “This year is extremely dry. Last year was a great crop year.”


 The particular area Gibson’s farm is located is a particularly dry area in the first place, she said. Even crops just a bit north or south of them are greener than their own. “When [we] farm, it’s almost like a gamble because we don’t have those timely rains like some areas do,” Gibson said.


 In 40 years of farming together, this isn’t the first time the Gibsons have faced growing seasons that are more challenging than the norm. “We’ve gone through this before, and we’ve weathered the storm before … we’ll get through it,” she said. Ultimately, Gibson’s attitude is to “hope for the best always” and she expressed a hopeful dependence on God to provide, saying, “He always does, even in the lacking times.”

 For the 2024-2025 marketing year, sales were reported at 507,000 tons. Exports last week dropped 25% to 200,800 tons, USDA said. 

 Wheat sales jumped to 578,500 metric tons, more than double the previous week and up 1% from the average, the department said. 

 South Korea took 119,000 tons, Mexico purchased 92,700 tons, China was in for 72,300 tons, Indonesia bought 70,000 tons and Italy purchased 61,000 tons of U.S. wheat. An unnamed country canceled shipments of 92,500 tons. 

 Exports for the week surged to 630,900 tons from 294,600 tons the previous week, USDA said in its report. 

 Thunderstorms are moving their way through the southern Plains this morning and will continue later this afternoon, according to the National Weather Service. 

 Some of the storms could bring damaging winds to the area, the agency said in a report early this morning. Storms are expected to continue from tomorrow through Wednesday. 

 Scattered thunderstorms are also forecast today for parts of central South Dakota, NWS said. 

 Severe weather will be isolated today, and there's a daily chance of storms through the weekend, the agency said. 

 Flooding is expected to continue on the Mississippi River along the Illinois-Missouri border. 

 The river at Hannibal, Missouri, was at 21.6 feet late Thursday, well above flood stage of 17 feet. The Mississippi is expected to recede to 20.7 feet by Monday morning, NWS said.

XtremeAg," XtremeAg farmer Lee Lubbers reports higher than expected wheat yields, while heat arrives in Iowa and Alabama.

 


 It is officially summertime harvest mode! We started the winter wheat harvest at the beginning of the week. Yields have been really good. It’s a slow go, but nobody is complaining, with the yields being good. We are running our combine, plus our custom harvester is running five machines. We split up into four- and two-machine crews. They have several other crews running in the central part of the state, around Pierre and Onida.


 All of their crews have moved up into South Dakota. The next moves will be North Dakota and Montana. By the time we are finished, it will be time to clean and prep to load and head out to jobs farther north.

 The pace is nonstop. They’ve come a long way from their first harvest stops, in Texas and Oklahoma, and the harvest push will go well up into Canada. Our wheat has been the best they have cut so far this year. We are crawling along at 1.5-2 mph, but for a good reason. They joke they can count the lugs on their tires while cutting.


 We finished up some R1 passes on part of our soybean crop, trying new things to see how the results are. Last year a bone-dry August skewed the data. There was too much variation in the passes to see a definitive difference. Hopefully, this year August will be more favorable. We also just got done doing some corn acres via plane just before tassel. Temperatures have been nice so far for July: many days in the 80s, buying us time on our row crops. Nice growing days, not scorching heat. But we all know the heat is coming. We are more used to 100°F days cutting wheat than 85°F.


 We are finishing up hauling our last 40,000 bushels of 2023 corn. We are binning wheat, and also shipping from the field to two different terminals. Wheat goes in one direction, then rock for road construction heads back. We will be focused on getting the wheat crop harvested. There’s a long way to go yet, and moving 400,000 bushels of wheat to take the pressure off storing fall crops in the next 30 days. With decent weather the combines should be loaded up and headed north within two weeks, and trucks will keep on humming. Summertime never stops, and neither do we. Stay safe, everyone.


 


 The heat has arrived for a few days, and because of the rain that we've had, our crop looks really good. We haven’t even turned on the irrigation yet, but it appears to me that tomorrow we will turn it on in a couple spots for the first time. Our pastures are holding on okay. We're getting to that time of the year where the brome is going downhill, which is the reason that we are doing the research with the rotational grazing and the other species of plants.


 I have been somewhat disappointed in the growth of these other plants, but the reason for the disappointment, I believe, is the chemical carryover: the atrazine from last year’s corn crop and even the herbicide from the soybeans in 2022. I think all farmers need to be aware of the chemical safety of the following year’s crops relative to what chemicals we’re using. The dry weather that we’ve had in 2022 and 2023 has allowed those chemicals to remain in that soil profile longer. I think we’re seeing the results of that in the disappointing growth.


 We’re going to stay with this rotational grazing program. We believe next year will be better. We’re continuing to learn, and it’s been an eye-opening experience to watch.


 


 Let’s talk about the drought for a second. There are a lot of different variables with soybeans and corn in the South. It just depends on whether we got rain or not.


 We’ve been in this drought and heat for the last three weeks. We’ve received some rains, but they have not been widespread. There has been some rain here, then you might get rain there, and then you might not get rain for another five miles or so. It’s just really hit or miss.


 The planting date for corn this year is really important. A lot of our early-planted corn is going to make it, significantly more than our late-planted corn. This is something we’ve seen a lot in the South when we’re trying to beat the heat. This is our normal weather pattern — we get this heat but we usually catch a good rain around the Fourth of July. When we didn’t get that rain, it really put us in a hole for rainfall this year. So the corn is drying down at a considerable rate because it’s been so hot. Some of our corn will be decent, but some of it won’t be as good.


 The early soybeans are in the same boat as the corn. In some places we’re putting fungicide on, and moving ahead with the right program where we’ve got rains. It doesn’t take a lot of rain, just a half-inch here and a half-inch there. We’re moving ahead and putting fungicide on other soybeans.


 I don’t know if you sprayed them that they would take anything in. They’ve got the leaves turned over. They’re just in bad drought stress, and they’re actually changing colors and turning yellow — you can see through them. So we’re not going to spend any more money on those until the weather changes and we see the soybeans try to turn around.


 But the soybeans that have received rain have good potential. The irrigated soybeans have good potential, and we’ve been keeping the water going — that’s a whole other struggle. We’ve been running about a dozen pivots, and I’m telling you, everyone on the farm has had their work cut out for them to keep these things going. Anyone who has worked with pivots before knows exactly what I am talking about. We are going to keep trying our best and hopefully get some good yields out of what we have.

 that “production capacity of sustainable aviation fuel in the United States could jump by 1400% in 2024 if all announced capacity additions come on line, the U.S. Energy Information Administration said on Wednesday.”

 “The EIA anticipates domestic production of (other) biofuels will increase by about 50% in 2024, led by rising SAF production,” Reuters reported. “…The EIA projects that SAF output will rise from 2,000 (barrels per day) to nearly 30,000 bpd in 2024.”

 Other biofuels, according to the EIA, includes sustainable aviation fuel (SAF), renewable heating oil, renewable naphtha, renewable propane, renewable gasoline, and other emerging biofuels that are in various stages of development and commercialization.

 
 that “Phillips 66’s Rodeo facility in California reached its renewable fuel production target of 50,000 bpd in June, of which 10,000 bpd is SAF. Valero’s Diamond Green project, in partnership with Darling Ingredients, at its Port Arthur, Texas refinery is expected to come online in the fourth quarter of this year and produce 15,000 bpd of SAF by the end of 2024.”

 “Investments in SAF have increased due to the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency’s Renewable Fuel Standard (RFS), federal tax credits, and state programs and tax credits incentivizing use of the fuel,” 
. “The White House also set a goal of meeting 100% of U.S. aviation fuel demand with SAF by 2050. About 1.6 million b/d of petroleum jet fuel was consumed in the United States in 2023, and we project U.S. jet fuel demand in 2050 to exceed 2.0 million b/d in our 2023 Annual Energy Outlook.”

 
 “that its projections for a tripling of Sustainable Aviation Fuels (SAF) production in 2024 to 1.9 billion liters (1.5 million tonnes) are on track. This would account for 0.53% of aviation’s fuel need in 2024.”

 “Renewable fuel production is shared by many industries and SAF is a part of renewable fuel production. That is why increasing the production of renewable fuel is key to increasing the potential of SAF,” the IATA said. “Some 140 renewable fuel projects with the capability to produce SAF have been announced to be in production by 2030. If all of these proceed to production as announced, total renewable fuel production capacity could reach 51 million tonnes by 2030, with production capacity spread across almost all regions.”

 “In December 2023 IATA reported that some 69 million tonnes of renewable fuel capacity were expected to be available by 2028. The most recent estimate is for 51 million tonnes of renewable fuel capacity to be available in 2030, based on currently announced projects,” 
. “Several factors have resulted in this reduced estimate. Most significant was an evaluation of projects against more stringent criteria for success and for the potential to meet SAF’s exacting sustainability criteria. Additionally, some projects have progressed at a slower pace towards commercial operations. With the right incentives, the potential for international aviation to reach a 5% reduction in carbon emissions by 2030 through SAF remains, provided policies are in place to increase the share of renewable fuel production allocated to SAF.”

 An ethanol-producing facility in northeast Iowa expelled excessive pollutants into the air for several years that can cause cancers and other health effects, according to the Iowa Department of Natural Resources.

 “Actual harm to the environment and public health likely occurred,” the department said in a recent administrative order regarding POET Bioprocessing near Shell Rock.

 The facility makes about 140 million gallons of ethanol each year, along with other products from the leftover materials of the fuel production.

 The excessive pollution was tied to one of those additional products: a protein ingredient for animal feed.

 The facility’s previous operator, Flint Hills Resources, installed the equipment that is used to extract the protein and began operating it in July 2020, the DNR order said. However, part of the system lacked sufficient pollution controls, which was discovered by POET in August 2023. POET had purchased the facility about two years earlier, but did not sample the emissions.

 Flint Hills had underestimated the amount of pollutants in the ethanol-production leftovers that are used to produce the protein, said Mark Fields, a unit leader for the DNR’s Air Quality Bureau. Those pollutants were then expelled during the protein processing.

 Fields said the issue was discovered with a similar system in another state, and POET shut down the production line and notified the DNR. The company later routed those emissions into an existing pollution-control system at the plant and fixed the problem.

 But emissions tests after the production line was reactivated revealed the extent of the excessive pollution in the previous years: Its volatile organic compounds emissions were 27 times its permitted limit, and emissions of a hazardous, cancer-causing compound — acetaldehyde — were nearly nine times the limit.

 The POET facility lies about two miles northwest of Shell Rock, and about five miles west of Waverly.

 POET agreed to pay a $10,000 administrative fine, the DNR order said. It also will pay nearly $43,000 in fees that it owed the state for its underreporting of emissions in 2021 and 2022.

 The company did not immediately respond to a request to comment for this article.
